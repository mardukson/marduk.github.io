<div align="left"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">There
was a reason that Douglas McCloud had so much instant faith, trust and
confidence in an eight-teen year old black kid named Damian Marson. And
that reason's name was Robert Maguthaba. He was young too, when McCloud
first took him under his wing. Not as young as Damian but in his
mid-twenties. </font></font><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"> </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He had
never seriously considered leaving his work in the hands of anything
else but another Melaninite, after Maguthaba left his fold. The fact
that they had better odds of living long enough to complete his work
had something to do with that but it wasn't nearly everything.
Melaninated people are going to perish too if no solution is found to
the breach problem. They just have more time and options. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">No,
it's because only black brilliance has the soul, or spirit to put such
energy into just helping people, instead of just into making money, or
trying to destroy life. White brilliance is great in both of the
latter, but it has a block when it comes to doing things for no gain,
or if it don't involve elevating themselves over others. Black
brilliance, on the other hand, has no limit or preconditions on how
high it will soar in the pursuit of the mental, spiritual, and material
progress of the species. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He had
always admired the biblical figure who built the tower of Babel. In a
sense, had even worshiped him by the way he had uninhibitedly pursued
his scientific goals to benefit Mankind as a whole. Martin Luther King
Jr, was another great influence in his life.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He became
an environmental expert in hope of discovering ways to end the shameful
scourge of worldwide hunger but he soon discovered that world hunger
was more a man made problem than an environmental one.
</font></font></p>
<p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Still,
he soldiered on until his research lead him to the horrifying reality
of the ozone breach threat, which led to his research with melanin,
which indirectly led him to recruit Mugathuba unto his team. The two
had grown very close during the years they worked together. He had
never been more hurt in his life than when Maguthaba left him.
Maguthaba insisted on going back home after 15 years with the McCloud
research team---back where there was no spotlight, glitter, or gold. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">At
that point in his life shine, glitter and gold was very important to
McCloud, if for no other reason but the money it generated for his
work. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Maguthaba went back home to Africa. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">The
reason he hadn't contacted his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in all these years
is not due to anger, jealousy, or rivalry, but to shame. The student
had proven himself to be a better man than the teacher in more ways
than one and no man can face the personification of that
acknowledgment--no matter how saintly he becomes in his dotage. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He was still glad that Damian had reached out to his old student. It was something he should have done himself, long ago. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">The
cancer in his leg was on the move. He could feel it eating away at his
gut. He had grown as fond of Damian as he was of Maguthaba. It looked
like he was going to be blessed to see them both together before he
dies. Not only that, he was going to die knowing he passed WoMankind's
last hope to survive the next breach onto the two most qualified people
in the world. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">More than that, he couldn't ask. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></p></div>
