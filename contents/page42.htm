was not by violence or fatal accidents; it was through a conscious

the power of love. They will be sorely missed and we all wish them well.<br><br>We
split up with the Soldiers we had been traveling with the past year,
three days ago. But four Soldiers chose to stay with us.

stood in silence. He knew what she meant because he felt the same way
about her. There was no desire, hunger or pleasure-seeking in what he
felt for Feifong. There was just something that getting to really know
her had put under his skin--inside his bones. And it was something that
could not be adequately explained by words. All he wanted for her was
her happiness and he didn't care how or where she got it. He loved her
like he loved Chandie, but with Chandie, he wanted <i>all </i>her happiness to come from him, alone.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"How are things going with Bruce?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She shrugged. </font><font color="#8000ff">"He hates you."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"What?"<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Not really, but he hates the time I spend scribing for you and the way I talk about you."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Fei,
what are you doing talking about me to Bruce? That's like me talking
about you to Chandie, which I don't do because I know that the only way
I will be able to speak of you, is in terms that she will never
understand. Tell me you don't talk like that to Bruce about me."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She hunched her little narrow shoulders again. </font><font color="#8000ff">"When he asks, I tell him. I can't help it if he doesn't understand the way things are between us. I'll never apologize for it."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Do you love him?"<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Yes." </font><font color="#000000">And
Damian knew it was true in Fei's version of romantic of love which was
probably a lot different from Bruce's,--if no less real and committed.</font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Then I'm warning you, Fei. You saw what happened to Steve. Don't take love for granted.

you gave up everything for me. Your unit, your peace of mind and even
your life since you think you are going to die at sea. I don't know
what to think or how to feel. I feel so selfish, so...undeserving."<br><br></font><font color="#004000">" I'd rather live five minutes with you than a lifetime without you."<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" There's so much imbalance between us. And I don't know what to do to make it more equal.<br><br></font><font color="#004000">" Just love me back, Ada. That's all. Don't complicate this, please."<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" I can't help it."<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"Okay,
let me ask you this...do you really believe that Lee and the others are
going to die from the breach in five of six years?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" I'm sure of it."<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"Then
you're saving my life because if it weren't for you, I would never have
left my unit. Not if god himself was aiming at us with nukes in both
hands. I think that equalizes things between us more than enough."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She studied him, eyes fixated on the way his chin rose when he said he would have never left them.<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"You miss them?"<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"Yeah,"</font><font color="#000000"> he sighed, </font><font color="#004000">"very much."<br><br></font><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 160);">"Then you</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 160);"> do</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 160);"> have regrets."</span><br><br></font><font color="#004000">"No,
Ada. No real man would chose something else--no matter what it is--
over the woman he loves. I'll never regret choosing you, it's just that
I've lived so long expecting, and willing to die with, and for those
guys, sometimes I feel like I've been separated from a part of my
flesh. But you've filled in that missing part, and when we have kids..."</font><font color="#000000">He grinned at her.</font><font color="#004000"> "You are going to bear kids aren't you?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"Not if you die at sea,"</font><font color="#000000"> she said in a tone that carried no lightness.</font><font color="#0000a0"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004000">"I love you, Ada."<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"I adore you."</font><font color="#000000"> She turned up her head and he kissed her.</font><font color="#0000a0"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br><br><br><br>*********************<br><br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Why did Lee change his mind and let the Iowees come with us?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#808000">Because they wanted to.</font><font color="#000000">"
Patrick sat on the ground beside Jane. It was late in the evening and
the group was stopped for the night. They were back to sleeping
outdoors, a fire in the middle of their camp was already roaring.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"But they seemed so much happier with Lee and the others than they were with us and Antonio."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"I
know it's easy to miss it, Janie, but the Iowees have minds of their
own. It may not seem like it because they are so quick to go along with
whatever is presented to them, but they have their own wants and
desires and they are a lot smarter and observant than you might think.
They wanted to go with Damian, because they heard the talk, and they
wanted to live. Besides that, they were always most attached to Chako
and Bruce."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"They are so lovable. I'm glad they are with us."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"So am I, but the guys back there--I don't know how Lee got them to hold still--they are really hurting right now."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Will you resent me one day?<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"For what?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Causing you to separate from your unit. I know how painful that is."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">No...no...Janie.</font><font color="#000000"> He caressed her face. "</font><font color="#808000"> I'll never blame you for that. The choice was mine. I don't regret it. I love you."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"You're hurt."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">" I'll get over it."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">" I'm so afraid that one day you're going to wake up and I won't be enough to help you live with the decision."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"
I would have died in a second for any of those guys, but believe me
Janie--no matter what happens between us in the future, I would have
made the same choice a thousand times without hesitation. You've given
me more joy than I've ever had in my life, and every minute with you
makes it all worth it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Tears brimmed in her eyes.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Hold me."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Patrick took her in his arms and quietly sat with her. <div align="left"><br><br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage57.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="270"> <br><br><div align="left"><font size="4"></font></div><font size="4">Damian heard her scream in his mind though he never heard her voice. <br><br>He ran through the camp in a panic. <font color="#800080">"Steve, Chandie's in trouble!"</font><font color="#000000"> He kept running.<br><br>The
big man, who was sitting with Michelle, scrambled to his feet and took
off after Damian. Michelle struggled to keep up with his long strides.<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"What's going on?"</font><font color="#000000"> Sheree cried in a shrill voice.</font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Come on!" </font><font color="#000000">Jane yelled behind her as she ran. </font><font color="#ff8000">"Chandra's in danger!" </font><font color="#000000">Patrick ran with them.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Feifong
looked at Bruce, who along with Chako was looking around wildly--both
still yet unable to read the frantic emissions to know what was
happening without being told. </font><font color="#8080ff">" It's Chandra!" </font><font color="#000000">Fiefong said. <span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">"</span></font><font color="#8080ff">She's being attacked!"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Bruce grabbed her arm. </font><font color="#800040">"Stay here."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040"><br></font><font color="#8080ff">" Let me, <i>go</i>!"</font><font color="#000000"> She snatched her arm loose and took off running after the others. Bruce and Chako followed.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br><br>****************<br><br>Damian
had seen her run before and he knew how fast Chandie could sprint--like
Flo Jo, of Olympics fame. He was grateful for it because right on her
heels were a pack of about 12 barking, growling dogs. The two closest
to her were Dobermen. They both were on the thin side and mangy looking
but they were still fast enough to gain on Chandie, and it was clear
they were single-mindedly intent on easing their hunger on her flesh. <br><br>The
two lead dogs were just a leap from her now and Damian was more than
twenty yards away. The hungry dogs were going to reach her first. </font><font color="#800080">"Drop Chandie!</font><font color="#000000">
He yelled both mentally and with his lungs. She instantly obeyed and
the two Doberman Pinschers jumped. They soared past her and Damian ran
by them to stand with Chandra.<br><br>The other 10 dogs caught up at
that moment. Damian put Chandie behind him and kicked the first dog
that reached them full in the face. All the others were ready to rush
them--one of them--some kind of Rottweiler mix-breed, crouched, showing
all it's healthy white teeth and Damian knew he and Chandra was in deep
trouble--trouble that for them, was going to end up very bloody.<br><br>Then
Steve showed up, running straight into the midst of the pack of dogs
kicking and yelling at the top of his lungs. The dogs scrambled, even
the big muscle bound mix-breed scurried back a few yards to access what
new thing he was up against. Seconds later, the pack regrouped,
encircling Damian, Steve and Chandra, moving forward again. The first
to rush in was the biggest Doberman, but close behind him were all the
others.<br><br>Steve grabbed the snarling mass of teeth and slobber by
the head and twisted. Damian leaped up and kicked the one that leaped
at him, and in the same motion turned in the air and punched the first
dog that jumped at Chandie. One of the dogs grabbed Steve by his left
leg and held on. Then another--a healthy pit bull-- clamped down on his
left arm. Damian punched the terrier on Steve's arm in the face again
and again but the dog wouldn't let go. His jaws had locked and his
teeth was churning. Suddenly the huge mix breed leapt on Damian's back
knocking him to the ground.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Damian!"</font><font color="#000000">
Chandra dove on the Rottweiler and grabbed him by the neck. The big dog
easily twisted his head loose and lunged at Chandra. Damian rolled on
his back and grabbed the big dog's hind legs just as his teeth snapped.
The dog yelped and yanked its legs from Damian's grasp. He lunged at
Chandra again. Bruce Akimota entered the struggle feet first. With the
velocity of a guided missile, the Asian Soldier kicked the big dog in
the head. Chandra could feel the heat from the dog's breath just before
it's head violently whipped away from her. The big dog rolled twice on
the ground and was still.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian
was back on his feet, pulling at Chandra, when Patrick and Chako showed
up. The smallest dogs Fled. Bruce karate chopped the dog that held
Steve's arm in the joint where its neck connected to its spine. The dog
flopped. Chako broke the back of the dog that had Steve's leg and the
remaining dogs ran yelping into the distance.<br><br>All the men had
outran the women and as the ladies came huffing up, Damian couldn't
help laughing to himself and thinking, even at that tense moment, that
Bruce, maybe--but none of the other men would have outran Chandie.<br><br>The
first of the women to reach the scene was Michelle. The last was
Sheree. Michelle, who was one of Antonio's Medics, looked at Steve's
bloodied arm and tore off the scarf she wore around her head. She
calmly approached Steve and began to administer to his wounds. Chandra
walked over to them. "</font><font color="#0000ff"> Let's get he back ti di camp. I mek sumting for dis."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#800080">Can you walk, Steve?</font><font color="#000000">"
Damian put his shoulder under Steve's left arm. He had called on Steve
during his moment of panic like it was second nature--as if it was
Steve's job to drop everything and be there when he needed him. And as
always, the big man had answered his call like it <b><i>was</i></b> his job, risking his life without a moment's hesitation. <br><br>At
this point, Damian knew he would do the same thing for Steve, but he
also knew it wasn't always that way with him. He never understood why,
but Steve had treated him like a close brother from the moment they
met. It took him a long time to completely trust the situation because
that kind of thing just don't happen between people--not in his world,
or any world. But the friendship was real. The loyalty is real. And it
was more than just in the mind and heart, it was in the blood.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Yeah,"</font><font color="#000000"> Steve answered Damian's question.</font><font color="#008080">
"the leg's not as bad as the arm. I know a Pit had my arm but what was
that mutt on my leg--teeth wasn't long enough to bust a grape but it
was holding on like crazy glue. Pit-bull wannabe... " <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
sensed a skit coming on, and he couldn't have looked more forward to it
if it was the opening to a Michael Jackson concert.<!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--> </font></font></div></font></font></font></font></font></div></div></body></html>
