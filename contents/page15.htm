looked around at all the people crowded into the little "emergency
room" her father and brother had built for her and thought about how
most of the same people had scorned and ridiculed her for so long. Some
even called her evil and a witch. It never angered her because she knew
most of them just didn't believe anybody could help them, medically,
but a doctor in a big building, wearing a white coat--and most
preferably a white skin. </font></font><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Even
the old people, who knew the skills of a Rootswoman and actually
preferred such care, avoided her. She was certain that shunning had
more to do with her looks than her skills. She looked about thirteen
years old until she was pushing thirty. <br>
People recognize there is racial discrimination or weight
discrimination and discrimination of a hundred different kinds but--in
her opinion--unless they are adults trying to do things an adult has to
do while still looking like a grade school kid, they know absolutely
nothing about the word. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">At
least she has recently started growing some into her age--and rather
nicely--if she must say so herself. She still didn't look twenty-six
but she did think she now, looked at least eight-teen. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Most
of the people were suffering a heat related illness. Those were easy
enough to remedy for the short term but she didn't have to be a
scientist to know that something was terribly wrong with the earth, and
that in the long run there was no herb or medicine in her cabinet or in
any <span style="font-style: italic;">hospital's</span> cabinet that was going to save these people. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></p></div>
