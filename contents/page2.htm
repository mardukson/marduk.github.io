almost dropped the carton of juice he was chugging at the sudden slap
of his mom's voice. He gulped down what had already entered his throat,
and set the drink back in the box. He turned sheepishly towards his
mom, because he knew when he went in that fridge and turned up that
carton, he was breaking a <i>couple</i> of rules. 

</font></font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000">Instead
of the frown he expected to see on her face, though, she was looking at
him as if he was some big ass, diamond engagement ring. </font></font></font></font></p><p>

He cut a bigger swath around her than he normally would have.

tripping just got weirder. He knew he was adopted, but damned, mom was
sounding like his girl, called him, when they were alone and she wanted
to do something nasty. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">He stopped, his face and tone clearly transmitting his irritation. <i>"<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">What</span></i><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> ma?</span>"

gleeful thoughts were interrupted when she suddenly grabbed him and
pulled him into that embrace he thought he had seen the last of when he
and ma had it out over that huggykissy stuff when he was thirteen years
old. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">He
didn't mind a kiss on the cheek or a quick hug, but he wasn't at the

squirmed his way loose and looked at her with the injured eyes of a
kicked puppy. When he looked in her face, he immediately felt like he'd
just done the worse thing he'd ever done in his life. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#800080">" What's wrong, ma?."</font><font color="#000000">

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#0000ff">"Damian, I'm so proud of you." </font><font color="#000000">

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">He stared at her, inquisitively. 

</font></font></font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#0000ff">"You
have always been such a joy in my life. When my Sister died giving
birth to you, nobody in the family thought I should take you because my
sister and I were twins and were so close. Even I had momentary doubts.
But she left you to me, Damian. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#0000ff">She
knew that she had no business getting pregnant. Neither one of us could
safely carry a child to term. By her second semester, everybody knew
she wasn't going to make it. She insisted that I be your guardian after
your father because everybody could see he wasn't going to make it
either. Lord only knows why that child let that man badger her into
risking her life because<i> he</i> wanted children. But I guess they both loved each other the same because after she died your father killed himself." </font><font color="#000000">

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Her voice was so full of pride and joy he felt embarrassed--for<i> </i><span style="font-style: italic;">her</span><i>.

</p><p><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"><i>So
that's what all this is about. That rich man, honky school done tapped
him as one of the few, the proud,the uppity, and mom thinks he's been
anointed by god for something. He knew they were going to let him in.

him since he was in the 9th grade. </i>

she was reaching for him again. This time, he allowed himself to be
dunked, he even hugged her back because suddenly it occurred to him his
days at home with her were about over. He had no intention of spending
the remaining ones doing anything other than showing his mom how much
he appreciated her for all she's done for him.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></font></font></font></p></div>
