giant puffed out his cheeks. Damian didn't think he was clowning, but
the man's rubbery cheeks filled up bigger, and rounder than a softball.
Any other time, Damian would have cracked up, but there was no laughter
in him these days. Steve exhaled deeply.<font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman"> "The mystifying, mesmerizing, paralyzing, and just plain old fucking , <span style="font-style: italic;">search defying</span>, pattern."</font> </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">It
had been a long time since Damian had heard or seen a joke from Steve.
He hoped he wasn't starting up again now. He had been trying to find a
pattern for three years. McCloud had been trying his entire career. The

a lot to do with that, but still...</font> </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Take a look at these, boss." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Steve
handed Damian a stack of graphs. Damian took them to his table and laid
them out. He instantly saw why they had never been able to find the
pattern before. They were looking at the whole thing from an entirely
wrong perspective. They were searching for typical, cyclical weather
patterns, when the breaches were not occurring with any kind of
periodicity at all. The earth was not moving towards hotter and hotter
weather, it was being struck by bigger and bigger sun strikes, with
longer and longer aftereffects. To put it in mythological terms; Zeus
was attacking the earth, or WoMankind. And judging from the pattern, he
was getting madder and more frustrated with every attack that left the
species of Woman still standing. Circling the globe in a determined
attempt to punish the WoMan race, the God was acting like an enraged
child. There was no identifiable design to it all, but there <i>was</i>
a pattern and a clear mathematically identifiable grid. He was aiming
for the big cities of the world, starting with the most historically,
destructive Nations.</font> </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">They
would have never found the pattern without the latest software written
for them by NASA. To see the pattern, they couldn't just factor in
climate patterns, weather temperatures, population, &nbsp;environmental
defects and effects, as they were doing; they had to also factor in
history, body counts, slavery, war, genocide. How NASA knew to do that,
he could only guess but he knew the great space agency had long been
deep into the occult and the whole mythological, god pantheon thing. </font></font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
heat from the breaches was an aftereffect of lightning bolts that
struck somewhere in the world. Before they received the surprise gift
from NASA, they were never able to record every single bolt, much less
correlate it with the heat wave that followed it. The strikes with
getting more powerful with each successive one. </font></font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#000000" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The pattern showed that Zeus was zigzagging in an increasingly wrathful and steady pace towards the United States. </font></font></font></font></font></font></p></div></body></html>
