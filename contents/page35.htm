<div align="left"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#408080">"I wouldn't be so all fired up and anxious to meet those guys if I were you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
didn't know if Steve was talking to him, or everybody. Everyone was
anxious, but the big man said "you" and looked at him the longest.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Why not?"</font><font color="#000000">
He couldn't understand what Steve's problem was. Other survivors could
well mean enhanced odds of survival for them all--especially when they
try to cross the ocean.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"Just
think about it, Damian. We survived because we were highly trained
experts with knowledge, skills, four years of preparation, a protective
balm that we never got the chance to mass produce--not to mention the
pattern. Who else are most likely to be alive at this point...a bunch
of people who were tucked away in a cellar somewhere?"</font><font color="#000000"> Steve shook his head. </font><font color="#408080">"I
don't think so. I think these other survivors are either well-equipped
special forces, or connected to the government in some other way--maybe
NASA. In any case, government...means bad news--always had, always
will."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I don't understand Steve, you worked on the thesis that projected there would be random survivors."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"What
we said, or meant Damian, is that in the beginning some people would
survive here and there, and most of them would be deathly ill. Any
survivors should have been encountered at the beginning. It's going on
four years, and now all of a sudden we see our first signs of robust,
living people? <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian sigh and rubbed his eyes. </font><font color="#800080">"You're right."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"I don't think so."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian turned to Chandra<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Why."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Because there are women with them...and children."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve turned to her in shock.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Are you sure Chandie?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yes, I can show you their footprints."<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"You didn't tell us this before," </font><font color="#000000">Mike said, snidely.</font><font color="#400080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"No one asked before, and she had no reason to think that there should be any reservations about meeting other survivors."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He
will overlook a lot from his jealous little brother, Mike, but there
was a limit, and that limit started and ended with Chandra Fontaine.<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"Do you have any idea how many there are Chandra...their physical break down? "</font><font color="#000000">Ada asked.</font><font color="#0000a0"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" I counted five men, four women, and two different sets of smaller prints."<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"That's nine adults and two children,"</font><font color="#000000"> Mike announced as if he was the only one gathered there who could count.</font><font color="#400080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian looked around the room.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you think? Do we risk making contact with them, or not?"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Five men could still mean trouble," </font><font color="#000000">Steve warned.</font><font color="#408080"> "There's only three of us."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Yes, but you count for two and a half men, big guy, so that makes us about even with them," </font><font color="#000000">Damian joked.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve
puffed out his chest and rolled up his right sleeve. He made his&nbsp;
bicep bulge and in a sterling imitation of Pop-eye, the sailor-- even
managing to squash down his face so that it resembled a peanut--, said:<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Aahh gagagagaga. It's because me eats me spinach every day, matey. </font><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgb(0, 204, 204);">"</span> <br>
<br>
The impromptu performance went on and on, never giving anybody a chance
to catch their breath. Even Mike was doubled over with laughter.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian managed to wheeze out, </font><font color="#800080">"Come on Steve...we've got-- "</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve grabbed a hysterical Ada and started singing, dancing her around on the top of his boat-like feet.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Me
Olive she loves me pipe, but me sprite she hates me spinach, that's why
I'm so big at night and me Olive's so tight and skinny. I'm pop-eye the
sailor man, toot! Toot!"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Twenty
minutes later, they managed to get the consensus. Due to Damian's urging, everyone agreed that
they would make contact with the other survivors...some, very
reluctantly.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></div>
