<font size="5"><b><br><br></b></font><font size="4">Damian wasn't naive
at this point in his life--if he ever was. Where he came from you grew
up fast and you learned things about the nature of people that other
segments of that society denied or kept hidden until most people were
already torn down and beat up by life, for believing in Hollywood and
the rest of the illusions that kept everybody searching for paradise in
a hellish world.<br>
<br>
He knew things weren't going to go perfect when the Soldiers and
Civilians merged but he was looking at the big picture: which was the
responsibility he felt to help his Charges survive by the best means
available.<br>
<br>
He wasn't surprised the least when personalities began to clash and
conflicts began to flair...only by how quickly and dangerously.<br><br>The
atmosphere shimmered with the promise of betrayal, broken hearts,
backstabbing and distrust. From the way the African soldier looked at
Chandra, he saw that not even he was going to escape the outcome of
what was already looming to be a big mistake.<br><br>Introductions were made:<br><br>The Latino, male Soldier said his name was Antonio George.<br>The Latino, female soldier's name was Sonya Ruiz.<br>The African, introduced himself as Said Mustafa. <br>Tameka, introduced herself again for those who hadn't already met her.<br>The Nordic, male declared himself to be Rick Carlyle.<br>Mesha, reintroduced herself.<br>The American Indian, soldier went by the name David Bravefeather.<br>The Asian, male soldier was John Huang.<br>The mix-blood, female soldier was Michelle Johnson.<br>The two ETs, were called Iowees.<br>The Male Iowee, called himself Firsthe Newman.<br>The Female Iowee, piped that she was named Firstshe Newman. <br><br>The
first day of their merger went well enough, but came the night,
everyone but he, Steve and Chandra, were searching for experience.
Holes suddenly opened up in relationships, where he never knew there
were cracks.<br>
It's was true that Sheree and Janet had stopped being affectionate long
ago but they were still a couple, always under each other, always
beside each other at night. <br>
<br>
The first day after meeting Antonio, Janet left Sheree.<br><br>Feifong spent that night in the arms of John Huang.<br><br>Ada put her injured heart in the hands of David Bravefeather.<br><br>Jane
gravitated to Rick after first giving Mustafa a clear offer to be the
one to end her loneliness. The African couldn't see her because he had
eyes only for Chandra.<br><br>Mike paired off with Mesha after she had given up on an unresponsive Steve.<br><br>Tameka watched the way Chandra hovered in quiet confidence around Damian and withdrew her net--for the moment.<br><br>Within
three days the honeymoons were over--all of them. The soldiers began to
get pushy and bossy, as if they thought Damian and his people were
skin-headed boots at their first day of training camp. <br><br>Jane
rejected Rick in disgust, after the second day of togetherness and had
sought refuge from his unwanted attention behind Steve's massive frame.
The handsome soldier restrained himself from harassing her with more
than passive, unwanted attention, but Damian knew he wasn't going to
let Jane put him off for long. Damian knew his type. It was all about
the ego with guys like that and his anger at both Jane and Steve was
ticking like a time bomb.<br><br>Steve showed the willingness to stand
up for Jane but he didn't show any willingness to sleep with her again.
He just couldn't do it--physically. Everyone in their group could feel
him crying for Ada. She was all he thought about. The big man was a
walking shell. Damian wanted so much to help his friend but didn't know
how. Ada just did not want to be with him anymore.<br><br>Ada's
relationship with Bravefeather lasted the longest. But it also soon
ended, although the two never had an argument that anybody heard.
Whatever she was looking for she didn't find it in Bravefeather. That
was probably because she was still in love with Steve. After three
nights she stopped sleeping with Bravefeather, preferring to be alone.<br><br>Feifong's
relationship with John Huang, barely lasted through one sexual
encounter. She knew from the moment she met him all she wanted was a
sex with the handsome Soldier to give her some relief from the pain
over Mike. The moment it was over, she discovered it wasn't enough, or
worth putting up with the man's vulgar personality. He tried to take
her by force their second night together, when she refused him, and
Feifong kicked him in the balls and ran to Damian's hut. The first
major fight between the two groups almost happened that night. It was
Antonio who smoothed the situation over, ordering his people to go back
to their beds.<br><br>Mustafa was testing, and disrespecting him to the
core of his manhood. He warned the African GI-Joe, over and over again
to stay away from Chandie. One day he had even seen him talking to her
animatedly while roughly shaking her shoulders. <span style="font-style: italic;">Manhandling</span> his woman. If Chandie hadn't begged and cried so hard, he would have Joe Fraziered the Ali, clone, right then and there.<br><br>For whatever reasons they might have had, Steve and Mike were right to vote against joining the Soldiers. And he was wrong.<br>
Now his people were in a situation that he could see no way out
of...but a fight. But how could they possibly fight such highly trained
men and women? He was the only one in his group with any kind of formal
self-defense training. Steve was big and strong, but big don't defeat
skill. <br>
<br>
He didn't know what to do but he did know that time was running out on
him on more fronts than one. The Soldiers were starting to make their
intentions perfectly clear. They were going to take over and take
everything they wanted from his group, which meant rape, slavery and
degradation was just over the dawn for his friends. <br>
Mustafa wanted a fight over Chandra. He knew that because he told
Mustafa that if he ever followed Chandra again when she went out
searching for food and herbs, one of them--he or Mustafa--wasn't coming
back to camp in one piece.<br><br>She said she wasn't going away from
camp until they figured out a way to separate from the soldiers. He
didn't know what changed her mind, but two days after that
conversation, when she thought he was asleep, she quietly got up from
beside him. He lay there motionless until she left their hut. Then he
got up to follow her. She was headed out of the camp and he sensed that
she was scared and crying. A moment later he saw a tall, hulking figure
following her and red flashed before his eyes. He was too confused to
know what to think--who to be maddest at-- or what was going on between
those two. <br><br>But he had warned Mustafa.<br><br><br><br><br>They
were standing in conversation. The moon was full and bright and he
could see them clearly. Mustafa had his hands on her shoulders, shaking
her again. She was crying. They didn't see him until he said:<br><br><font color="#800080">"Chandie, come here."</font><font color="#000000">
Chandra turned and gasped. Mustafa snatched his hands from her
shoulders and stood there grinning back at Damian. But it wasn't the
haughty smirk that he usually gave to Damian--it was more a tortured
grimace. For the first time Damian saw that having Chandra wasn't the
same with Mustafa as the ego-driven need his fellow soldiers had to
claim every woman they wanted. The black Adonis, was in love.<br>
<br>
Chandra ran over to where Damian stood and stopped in front of him like a road block. He brushed past her.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"I told you to stay away from her."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Mustafa's eyes were more feverish than fiendish.<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Sir, I can't do that. I love her"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
had the desire not only to hurt the man physically, but also every
other way he could think of. Just because he loved her, meant to him,
that it was alright to forcefully come between two people who were
already together in love and had told him that.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You
don't love her. And you want to know why? Because there are a hundred
things about her you haven't seen yet. The funny faces she makes when
she combs her hair. The way she giggles at her own corny jokes. The way
she squirms up against you at night when she gets a happy thought. How
she kisses you. Feels so good in your arms you wouldn't trade a spot
beside her for a spot in heaven with a thousand virgins. Until you know
her for at least five minutes when she isn't crying, you have no idea
what loving her is."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Mustafa licked his lips--for a moment looked like a dog staring at a pork chop on a high shelf, behind a thick pane of glass.<br><br>He
quickly recovered, tried to smile, show Damian the smirk, but it was
too late. Damian had already seen the weakness in his eyes.<br><br>Chandra looked into Damian's eyes and moved back in front of him. She had a vision and it was unfolding right before her face.<br><br><i></i></font><i><font color="#0000ff">"No!"</font></i><font color="#0000ff"></font><font color="#000000"> She wailed. </font><font color="#0000ff">"Damian stop...please stop!"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Get out of the way, Chandie." </font><font color="#000000">He pushed her aside.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>She grabbed his arm and tugged. </font><font color="#0000ff">"let's go...Damian. <i>Let's gooooeee!</i>"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Her cries were heartrending but she wasn't going to move him this time.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Sooner or later baby, this has got to be settled...one way or the other."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000">The
Soldier was 3 inches taller than he and about 20 pounds heavier--a
highly trained killer. But it was never fear that prevented him from
having this out with Mustafa, when he should have. He was never afraid
in his life. Where he grew up you couldn't afford the luxury of
fear--not of knives, bullets, gangs--and definitely not of a single
rival. That was something you learned early in the hood. Eight year old
boys would windmill away at teen-agers twice their size until they were
beat down into the dirt. The next day they would do it all over again
until everybody knew that you could be beat to death but you couldn't
be punked. That was rep. In the hood everybody had to have one. If you
wanted to live with any kind of dignity you had to get yours early.<br><br>His
Mom had grown up in that environment. She loved him like a fish love
water. That's why she made him take self-defense courses from the time
he was five years old.<br><br>He never feared a fight with Mustafa. It
was that he had a dream for the world--this new opportunity-- to do
things differently; with the others--to build something better for
themselves and their children. The easy way is to resort to violence,
to take what you wanted, rather than to earn it, deserve it, make it
want to come to you under its own initiative.<br><br>Chandra was never
going to leave him for Mustafa, and so now the soldier wanted to resort
to the old tried and true method of just taking what he wanted by force.<br><br>He would give the man the shirt of his back to save his hopes for the future.<br><br>But he wasn't going to give him Chandie.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Baby, go back to camp."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"<i>Noooo!"</i><br><i><br></i></font><font color="#800080">"Don't worry. I promise I won't hurt him too bad. " </font><font color="#000000">He smiled at her.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Damian walk away from this...pleeeease...for me."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He sighed. </font><font color="#800080">"How
long am I supposed to do that, Chandie? I may as well go ahead and hand
you over to him now because he's never going to give up. He loves you.
And he thinks I'm too weak to keep him from taking you from me."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000">He looked into her eyes and put his hands on her shoulders--like Mustafa did.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Go back to camp...right now. Or go over to Mustafa."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She opened her mouth.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Don't say anything else Chandie. You want to end this your way, go to him." </font><font color="#000000">He gave her a light push. "</font><font color="#800080">Go on!"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She twisted around and punched him in the chest as hard as she could.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"He'll <i>kill </i>yuh!"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"One
of you are going to kill me. Make a decision Chandie, or I'll make it
for you. I don't want you to see this fight. If I walk away because you
won't leave, don't follow me. If you go to camp, don't run to Steve and
don't come back here. I mean that Chandie. If I win I'll come back to
you. If I lose I'll be beaten to death and I don't ever want you to see
me like that, you hear...not even to bury me."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Her pupils were swimming in tears.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yuh bastard."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She turned to Mustafa.</font><font color="#0000ff"> I'll never be with yuh! I'll kill yuh! I swear I'll <i>kill </i>yuh!"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#804040">"We'll see."</font><font color="#000000"> Mustafa responded</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Chandra turned and started running as fast as she could.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"No you <i>won't </i>see."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian started striding purposely toward Mustafa.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Because I'm going to knock your eyeballs out of your head."<br><br><br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve looked up and saw Chandra running like she was on fire, her breaths coming in great heaves.<br><br>He ran up to her and grabbed her arms. </font><font color="#408080">"What's the matter, Chandra?"</font><font color="#000000"> She snatched loose and ran past him. Steve read her emissions.</font><font color="#408080"> "Where <i>is </i>he?"</font><font color="#000000"> He called after her.<br><br>He turned and looked in the direction she came from.<br><br></font><font color="#008040">"Stay out of it, Sasquatch."</font><font color="#000000">
Rick moved in front of Steve. David Bravefeather slowly walked up to
the left of him. John Huang moved to the right of the big man. </font><font color="#008040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve
swung at Rick, who easily ducked the telegraphed, amateurish attempt.
The Nordic soldier came back up and grinned widely before snapping the
big man's head back with a standing drop kick. Ada ran over cursing in
that voice that earned her the pipsqeak moniker from Damian.
Bravefeather grabbed her and swung her around, nearly dislocating her
shoulder. <br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Rick, <i>stop</i> it!"</font><font color="#000000"> Jane yelled. </font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008040">"Don't worry, I will. Just as soon as I finish stomping bigfoot's face into the dirt."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">By this point the entire camp had gathered around the fight. Janet yelled something in spanish to Antonio, who ignored her.<br><br><br>Steve
was on his knees, about to receive another kick to the head when Mike
charged inside the circle, head first and bowled the blond soldier
over, swinging both arms like a windmill as he landed on top. <br><br></font><font color="#0080c0">"Dumb move fathead."</font><font color="#000000">
John Huang flew at Mike, leading with his feet. The bull-like man took
a boot square in the face. His nose spouted blood as he toppled to the
side. Feifong shrieked. She charged her newly discarded lover, clawing
at his face like a demon. Bravefeather, ran over and slapped her to the
ground.</font><font color="#0080c0"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve
roared liked a lion when Feifong fell screaming in agony beside him.
His rubbery face even took on the resemblance of a lion. He caught yet
another attempt by Rick to kick him, in mid-swing and twisted. He
shoved Rick ten feet backwards and stood up. Bravefeather's eyes
widened at the bloody, animalistic face that turned towards him but he
wasn't conditioned to run. He stood rooted in his spot as Steve yanked
him by the neck and pulled him forward. The big man headbutted the
young Indian and slammed him to the ground on his back. Bravefeather
twitched once and was still. Then Steve turned to John Huang. The Asian
soldier grinned, bouncing on his toes. He beckoned Steve to come to
him. Steve charged. John Huang dropped into a crouch and rolled into
Steve's legs, bowling him over. Before Steve could move, Rick and John
was at him, kicking and swinging with all they had.</font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Sheree lurched forward and Mesha spun her around. </font><font color="#ff8080">"Stay out of it Trick."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"That goes for you too, Cinderella. "</font><font color="#000000"> Tameka warned Jane.</font><font color="#ff8040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike
never moved again after being stomped in the face, but Steve was still
moving and still being viciously kicked by Rick and John.<br><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"<i>Stop this</i> Antonio!"</font><font color="#000000"> Janet begged.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" I will, sweetheart...just as soon as we finished teaching you Civs, once and for all, who's boss in this camp."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane suddenly whirled and elbowed Tameka in the face. She ran over and fell on Steve, covering him with her body. <br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Goddammit, y'all better kick her ass too!" </font><font color="#000000">Tameka screamed. Blood spurted from her nose.</font><font color="#ff8040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Don't worry Tam."</font><font color="#000000"> Mesha said. </font><font color="#ff8080">"She just made a mistake she's going to regret the rest of her life--if she has any life left when I'm finished."</font><font color="#000000">
The Nordic, female soldier, walked over and yanked Jane to her feet.
Then she threw her to the ground away from Steve and started kicking
her. Tameka joined her, both of them lashing out at Jane with their
feet like they intended to stomp her to death. Then they looked up at
Michelle, eyes demanding to know why she wasn't fighting beside them.</font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"<i>Antonio!"</i></font><i><font color="#000000"> </font></i><font color="#000000">Janet was hysterical.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Look,
I like you. I like you a lot, and when this is over you are still going
to be my main woman. But let me tell you something...we"</font><font color="#000000">--Antonio swung his arm in an arc-- </font><font color="#ff0000">"are
a unit-- a team. For five years we've been together, killing together,
dying together, eating, sleeping together. Do you know what it means to
pledge your life to a team--your soul? If you don't, you better
recognize quick because if you open your mouth just one more fucking
time, you're going to be right down there on the ground beside <i>that </i>stupid whore."<br><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"Fuck <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>!"</font><font color="#000000"> Janet's tone was guttural with hatred.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"What did you <span style="font-style: italic;">say</span>?" </font><font color="#000000">Antonio walked up to Janet and punched her so hard, her left cheek caved in.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Jan!"</font><font color="#000000"> Sheree screamed.</font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Shut that up."</font><font color="#000000">
Antonio ordered. He was looking at Michelle. She didn't move. Antonio's
eyes narrowed. Sonya hastened forward and grabbed Sheree by the throat.
Antonio looked at Michelle harder, his lips pursed with indecision.
Then he looked away. </font><font color="#ff0000">"I'm tired of this shit. I'm going to see what's taking Moose so long." </font><font color="#000000">He said to Rick: </font><font color="#ff0000">" If y'all kill Sasquatch, and the bitch who suckered punched Tameka, that's alright. But don't--"<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Don't what?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Antonio
turned around to see if the owner of that voice was really there. He
looked, saw Chandra first, but that wasn't what caused his eyes to
widen. Around her were some people he hadn't seen in over a year and
was beginning to think he'd never see again. At the head of them was a
man he has been in a running battle with for six years.<br><br>There
were ten of them, six of them men, four of them women. Like his unit,
they were a diverse racial group. They were also Special Forces
recruits of the U.S. government.<br><br>The difference was, most of them weren't as handsome and beautiful as he and his crew. <br><br>Antonio
didn't know why they cut off hostilities but he could guess. Their
weapons weren't working and they couldn't be sure if his were.</font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Chandie
knew the Soldiers were trailing behind. She saws signs of them two days
ago. She didn't know if they were Hostiles or friendly so she never
told the others to avoid an unnecessary confrontation. She figured if
they were Friendlies, they would show themselves when they got ready.
If they were Hostiles, they weren't much of a threat because they were
outnumbered.<br><br>The vicious attacks on Jane and Steve, ceased. The
matinee idols drifted together in a show of solidarity to face some
real opponents. <br><br>The two Iowees shrieked with joy and ran to
the newly arrived Soldiers like they were long lost family. The latest
group of Newcomers reacted the same way towards the little Beings,
bending down and hugging the Iowees in turn.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Lee, long time no see. Where you been boy?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">A tall, bespectacled black man responded to Antonio's question.<br><br></font><font color="#808000">" Here and there... none of yours works either, huh?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Oh, I don't know, maybe."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Well I do."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee glanced at Chandra.</font><font color="#808000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Antonia shrugged. </font><font color="#ff0000">"We can't let you have them, Lee.

looked back at the Iowees, who were peeking out from between a stone
faced Asian soldier, and an equally grim faced American Indian, who
were both staring ahead with the muscles in their jaws bulging.<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Looks to me like I've already got them."<br><br>
</font><font color="#000000">Lee nodded to his Recruits, and they started moving forward.<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Those
Civs, need immediate medical attention and you're holding up the
Medics. So I'm going to give you two choices Tony. Take your people and
move on...save this for another day. Or get ready for the quickest,
most thorough ass-whipping in the annuls of time. "<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Come on Lee...you know I can't leave without the Iowees."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Then I guess you've only got one choice."<br><br><br><br></font><font color="#000000">****************</font><font color="#808000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian
was down on one knee. Mustafa had just kicked him in the groin. He
couldn't catch his breath but Mustafa was in too bad a shape to take
profit from his advantage. By the time he got up off the ground to
approach Damian for a deciding blow, Damian was breathing easy again.
When Mustafa aimed a less than energetic boot at his face, Damian
caught his leg and twisted his foot. Mustafa hit the dirt hard, face
first. Damian struggled to his feet. Mustafa's face looked like an
over-inflated soccer ball, his eyeballs were still there but Damian was
only half off on his declaration. If Mustafa could still see, it was
only in triple vision and even that little window to the world was
closing up on him fast. One eye was already swollen shut. The other was
a slit. Damian stood over him, about to put an end to the long, brutal
fight when he saw that the man had given up. Mustafa was curled up like
a fetus and muttering.<br><br>Damian was too tired to finish him off anyway. <br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Mustafa,"<i>Mustafa!"</i></font><i><font color="#000000"> </font></i><font color="#000000">Damian nudged the moaning man in the side, with his foot.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Okey mooomy. "<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"It's Damian."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Dah...meee...oon?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Yeah. Who do Chandra love?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Chandra?'<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You heard me. Whose woman is she?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"Chandra iz Dah..mee..oon's woman."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"That's right. And you're not going to bother her again are you?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"No."</font><font color="#000000"> Mustafa coughed up blood in the middle of saying "no" so Damian's ears weren't satisfied.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"What?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"No, sir." </font><font color="#000000">He said more clearly.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian left him and started back to find his woman.<br><br>What he found first, was a battlefield but the fighting was over.<br><br>There
was only Antonia, John and Rick against six other men who were as
highly trained warriors as they. David Bravefeather still lay
unconscious from the head-butt given to him by Steve.<br>Antonio. Rick
and John fought to the height of their considerable abilities but they
were kicking and swinging against mirror images who outnumbered them
two to one. They fell hard but swiftly like Lee had promised.<br><br>The
female soldiers fought more evenly matched than the men had, but once
the victorious men entered the fray that fight was also over quickly.<br><br>By the time Damian limped into view of the campsite, twelve broken and unconscious bodies lay stretched out on the ground. <br>Chandra,
Sheree, Ada and Feifong were tending to them. Chandra was moving so
slow, it looked to Damian like she was going through the motions while
in a state of shock. Then she looked up and saw him. She screamed, <br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Oh my god! <i>Oh my god!..Damian!"</i> <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Damian felt like a million
dollars at her reaction to seeing him. If the woman ever got tired of
running she wasn't showing it that day. She had him leaning on her
before everyone else was aware he had appeared over the ridge.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Go help them."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee ordered.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>A
blond female soldier and a Latino male soldier, with dragonhunter
patches on the shoulders of their uniforms, took off in a sprint.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"I <i>got</i> him!</font><font color="#000000">" Chandra screeched when they approached.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004080">"Ma'am, let--"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"<i>No!</i> Get away...get <i>awaaay</i>!"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Chandie."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian sounded like he had a mouth full of marbles. He looked like he had been in a train wreck.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Shut up, bwoy."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I love you."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"I <i>hate</i> you."</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"I'm sorry, baby."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">'I thought you were dead.</font><font color="#000000">" She sobbed. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></p>
