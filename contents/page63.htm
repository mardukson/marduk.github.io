told Janet what Damian and he planned to do, and couldn't help smiling
himself as he watched her face light up. She was looking nothing like
the beauty she used to be. She was never beaten during their captivity
but she had been raped daily for almost two months. Something inside
her had fled during those months of helplessness.<b><br></b><br>Before
the moment he told her they were escaping, she looked like someone who
had lost their spark; tired, old, going through the motions of living
only because to kill herself took a passion for accomplishing something
that she just did not have. But suddenly she was charged with a new
energy, the faded beauty was already beginning to shine through again
in the way the color had come back into her pallid complexion.<br><br>Mike didn't dare talk to her long, so he moved on, to work on the tasks he had been assigned.<br><br>Antonio
had set up the camp about a mile inland. Mike warned him about staying
in the buildings so they were set up in a park-like area that had once
been cleared but was now growing into woods again.<br><br>When they
first arrived on Trinidad, Antonio wanted to re-supply and move on the
next day, but Mike used the Island's scarce vegetation as an excuse to
convince him to stay longer; to find more food in case the other
Islands were just as fruitless.<br><br>That was two days ago. Damian
should arrive today. He will wait for dark and Damian's contact. Then
he and Janet will make a break. The nearest woods were a quarter of a
mile away.<br><br>He will go first, so Janet can make excuses for his
whereabouts if need be. He needed more time than she did to reach the
woods. Ten minutes later she will make her break. He will guide her to
him with his mind. If he and Janet can go missing unreported for 15
minutes, that will be time enough for Damian to arrive. He told Janet
about the Tiger so she wouldn't be frightened if she ran into the cat.<br><br><font color="#ff0000">" Fathead"<br><font color="#000000"><br>Mike almost jumped out of his skin. He was so lost in his thoughts, Antonio and his entire crew had walked up on him.<br><br>He struggled to calm himself, react normally. <br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"What?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" I warned you not to fuck with me didn't I?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike
felt frantic, even though he couldn't image what the man was talking
about. He heard sobbing and looked over to see Janet standing between
Tameka and John Huang. His heart sunk.<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"What are you talking about?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" What am I talking about?"</font><font color="#000000"> Antonio pressed his index fingers to his temples and concentrated.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike heard him speaking inside his head<br><br><i>I know that you've been talking to Damian. I know all about your plans.<br><br></i>Mike's face turned light green and he looked like he was going to faint.<br><br>Antonio laughed</font><font color="#ff0000">.
"I was going to let you live. You and the shriveled up hag over there.
A man can never have enough slaves--even gimps and dried up whores, but
you just had to betray me didn't you? You fucking Civs know absolutely
nothing about truth, loyalty and honor."</font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Mike opened his mouth, but shut it again when he heard Janet.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" You're going to die, Fathead, but I'm going to offer you a deal. You cooperate with me, and I'll give you an easy death."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike burst into laughter. </font><font color="#0000a0">"An easy death? You think I'm afraid of what you can do to me?"</font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Antonio smiled in the face of Mike's laughter. </font><font color="#ff0000">" No. I know if I were you, I wouldn't be. I know you're not afraid of death, me or anything I can do to you.</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#ff0000">But
I also know how you feel about Janet. Let's not waste my time Mike. You
know what I can do to her and you know you don't want that."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike sighed. </font><font color="#0000a0">" What do you want me to do?"</font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Antonio's eyes flashed. </font><font color="#ff0000">" I'm really going to enjoy killing  you. So many games, so much bullshit. You're a bright guy, Mike. What the fuck do you <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span>
I want you to do? I'm getting pissed Fathead, and if you have it in
your mind to waste one more second of my time, I'm going to forget all
about strategy and give in to the hate I feel for you right now.
John..."</font><font color="#000000"> Antonio called out.<br><br>The Asian Soldier immediately jabbed Janet in the throat with two fingers.<br><br>She doubled over wheezing and choking like she was going to die.<br><br>Mike lunged. Antonio drew his arm all the way back and backhanded him across the face.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" David..."</font><font color="#000000"> He called out.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Bravefeather
walked over to Janet who was still struggling to get her breath back.
He grabbed her left arm and twisted it high behind her back. She didn't
have enough wind to scream but the sound she made was worse than any
cry of agony could ever be.<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" Alright, alright!..<i>.alright</i>...please. I'll set it up...anything. What do you want me to tell him? "<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000"><br>"
Tell Damian you've escaped and you and Janet are waiting for him at the
south end of the Island. If you or Janet tells him anything different
or anything else, I'll know it, and I'll kill you. I really would like
to use you as a chip, but I'll get by, and you can let your imagination
run wild about what I'll do to Janet, and I swear, you'll still never
get close to the reality. "<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000a0">I'll do anything you say. Just don't hurt her anymore...<span style="font-style: italic;">please.</span>"<br></font><font color="#000000"><!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></font></font></div><div></div><font size="6"><font size="4"><font color="#ff0000"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden"> </font></font></font></font><div></div><!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--><font size="6"><font size="4"><font color="#ff0000"><font color="#000000"></font></font></font></font></font></body></html>
