and I decided to stay in Boston; mainly because Mr. McCloud is such a
genuinely nice and sincere old Kat. Also a little delusional, but that's
just my worthless opinion. </font></font><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Says
he wants me to head his scientific team. How crazy is that? I know
things have changed in the world with the breach and everything but
there is no way they've changed <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>
much. An 18 year old black kid, walking into a lab of long time
collaborators--white collaborators-- and becoming their boss. I just
can't see it and I told the old man that...but since he's been so good to
me, I promised to show up tomorrow just so he can see for himself, what
anyone else--who didn't have his head of white hair so full of
worries--would already know. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">I
don't know why he has to insist on putting me in charge of the lab. I'm
more than willing to start where I'm supposed to and work my way up. I don't care about titles at this point in my
career. I just want the space and equipment to start trying to find
solutions. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Stubborn
old Einstein-looking, mule. He must have his reasons though. There's no
way, a man that smart is going to be stirring up any unnecessary
disruptions among his team without a good reason. It could be, he
thinks I'm going to be the last one standing--which is probably true if
all the others on his team are light-skinned people. I haven't
officially met any of them yet, although I think I've seen a couple of
them talking to Mr. McCloud. </font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He told me there were 8 of them, said they've all been together for over ten years--some of them far longer. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">The
old guy is just begging for disappointment. Some people just have to
experience a kick in the head before they can envision a mule's back
end rearing up that high. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Boss
or peon, I just want to get to work so I can help the scienctific community with the breach problem--<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">and get my mind off Sheree.
<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Now I know why I never saw anybody who looked like they might have been
close to Sheree in the love shack department. That's because I was
looking for dawgs when I should have been looking for kitty-kats. I see
plenty of shack buddies now. And she's showing me more and more
everyday, what she prefers. I wish&nbsp; she had'na deviated from her
preferred path with me, though. I'm trying hard to accept her
explanation and let it go.&nbsp; But it's like I've been shot
through the heart or something. Acting like those dudes I used to laugh
at, and scorn in the movies. Can't eat, can't sleep. All these fine,
young melanin chicks up here just throwing the trim at me and I'm
moping around like Sheree's got a magnet in hers with my dick's name
on it. </font></font></p>
<p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">But it's not just the sex. She whipped it on me alright. Can't no young chick know moves Sheree got, yet. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">But
as much as the sex, it's the way she smells, the way she laughs, the
sound of her voice, the way she walks...everything about her has got me
hooked. Since she's one of a kind, I don't know how I'm going to get
over her, but I will...I have to. There's too many things that I have
to concentrate on, to have my mind so full of Sheree all the
time. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Maybe,
hopefully, things will work on in McCloud's Lab but I'm already
weighing other options. I don't have anymore stress to put into
McCloud's stubbornness than I do in Sheree's rejection. </font></font></p><p><!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></p></div><div></div><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden"> </font></font><div></div><!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--></body></html>
