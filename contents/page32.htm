devastating Zeus lightning bolt, will hit in the Southern hemisphere.
There have been strikes there and in Europe all along, but Zeus was no
longer shooting arrows, he was launching missiles.<br>
<br>
The pattern showed that there was going to be a&nbsp; window of calm
before Zeus' next strike. Africa is undoubtedly still right now being
devastated by the heat waves and after effects from the big bolt that
hit the Middle-east. <br>
The bolt that hit Europe, is probably manifesting most of its damage in Asia. <br>
<br>
In about six and a half years, they will reach the Southern hemisphere.
By then, it will be devastated like the Western, but the heat waves
will be manifesting across the ocean, in a gross overkill, into an
already submerged, Europe<br>
<br>
The reason why Damian didn't fly to Africa with Maguthaba, and why no
Government of the world ever put up a real fight against Zeus, was
because even though his team would have had seven years of respite, to
prepare for the next breach, there was no preparing for Zeus' bolts,
sitting in a lab, staring at graphs and into microscopes, or in shaking
your fists, or missiles. That illusion was over. <br>
<br>
To survive, they had to adjust--like the plants. The only way to do
that was to get out into a changing nature, earth, universe, and
survive it, under its own terms. That's why they started their journey
at the outer edge of the United States. They will travel the length of
the devastated Country and learn to adapt to the new environment.
During their journey, exposed to the new changes in the vegetation,
atmosphere, gravity, atomic structure of the earth's gravitational
field, there will be changes in their bodies, their blood, their
eye-sight, their system's ability to absorb food, air, moisture,
medicine,their brain's ability to read and decipher distance, time,
space.<br>
<br>
They had six years to adjust. Six years to reach Africa, the last projected victim of Zeus' rage--at least for a while.</big><br>&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden">
