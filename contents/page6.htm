</p><p><font size="4">

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I've always known that gal
loved me. It doesn't matter how much we dislike each other at times or
how long we go without speaking; Lonetta and I will always love each
other. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I don't know if she knew it
or not but she might have saved my job. This school is fanatical about
recruiting my godson and people were whispering that I might be a
hindrance to Damian deciding to come here because his mother and I are
on the outs. How the hell they know so much about my business I can
only guess. The way these people have been acting since the ozone
breach, they wouldn't have had to worry about renewing my tenure. I was
sick and tired of them before. After that breach there was no way in
hell I was going to be able to stand it around here. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Lonetta says he's coming for sure;that he's already on the plane. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">And that's the <i>only reason </i>I'm
going to accept a new contract to teach here. Even so, I'm going to
have it written in there that I only stay as long as my godson do. I'd
be surprise if Damian makes it past a single semester. That boy is just
too smart for the bullshit they try to put over around this place. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">They just want to use him
anyway. McCloud would literally drop dead if he loses Damian to another
school or some high paying commercial job. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I like that old man, and I
fully understand why he's so desperate to recruit Damian, but Einstein
better get a grip because that child is only seventeen and I'm not
going let them burden that boy with the weight of the world. McCloud
seems to think Damian is the answer to the whole Ozone breach problem
but the entire world scientific community is working on that situation
and Damian is not Jesus. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Lonetta sounded sooo tired
over the phone. I feel in my bones something is wrong but of course
like always, she takes all the heart out of somebody for wanting to go
see her with her Pollyanna bullshit. That's why I haven't been back
there. That Gal got a way of making you feel that you're never welcome
even if she do talk that come to see me spiel. That thing don't want
anybody to come to see her. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">She and I used to be like the two sides of a nickel. After her twin died we were like one side of a coin--we were so close. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Lonetta could have gone to
college and I know that me going overseas on scholarship was why she
started changing towards me. She could have had a life like mine but
she chose to take in her sister's child. Put her whole life into a kid
that wasn't even hers. Never did get out the neighborhood. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I got out though;traveled
the world. I know that's why she really don't want me coming back.
She's ashamed that she never got anywhere in life. Maybe in the
beginning I was at fault for putting those feelings in her. I truly
hated that child coming between us--taking attention away from me.
Ruining plans that Lonetta and I made from the time we were little
girls. Lonetta knew we'd promise to do life together. She betrayed me
for a stranger, and I know I let her know how I felt. How could I not?
She hurt me terribly. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">But I truly did get over it. I don't think Lonetta accepts that to this day. Too much water under the bridge I guess. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Despite all the hurt, I only blamed Damian for about 2 hours. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">That's how much time passed
after he was born before I held him and looked into his adorable face.
I know damned well Lonetta knew from the beginning it wasn't about
Damian but about she and I only, with him simply caught up in the
middle. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I've always loved that
child. To follow his academic notoriety that began almost from his
first year of school has been a true source of happiness to me. I
suspect that that's another reason that Lonetta kept trying to make it
about Damian long after she knew it wasn't. She knew Damian was
something special that she had and I didn't. She simply didn't want me
to share in that. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">She made me his godmother,
though. That's something. But I never really got to experience as much
with Damian as I would have liked. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Now I get my chance. <i>Thanks Letta</i>. And I am so happy. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">This kid has already written a highly respected paper on nature and environment; wrote it when he was just 15 years old. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">That's why McCloud and all these schools are after him so. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Hopefully, Damian will be a bridge for me and Letta to get close again. She isn't getting any younger and neither am I. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><i>Letta I miss you gal</i> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Thanks for trusting me with your son. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I know this is your way of
showing me something that so much pain and hurt over so long a time
would have never allowed either one of us to say any other way. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I know now that I can go back home again. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><i>I'll be seeing you Letta. <b>
