<font size="4"><font color="#800080">"In four months, we will finally
reach New York. From there we will take another six months to prepare
for the long journey across the Atlantic. We have survived alone in the
world for almost four years. There are still the nine of us. Our days
consist of foraging for food in the morning, traveling in the midday,
and huddling for warmth at night. There is rarely a need for fire, but
during the cold months, there is a need for makeshift shelter.
Sometimes we stay in one place for a while, but rarely longer than a
few months. <br><br>We all seem to be growing stronger physically, as
well as mentally. So far our progress is good, and we have yet to
encounter any real threat to our lives. Our journey continues.<br><br>Today is the eighth day of November, year 2012. A.D."<br></font><br><br><br><br><br><font color="#8000ff">"Is that it?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I sign off the same way, every time, Fei."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#8000ff">Yes, but usually you have so much more to say?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"That's why I have so little to say now; I'm starting to repeat myself?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Feifong
laughed. She put her pen and paper away in the airtight box that she
seemed to prize as much as Damian prized its contents. <br><br>Like
Jane, she had blossomed since they began their journey. She looked like
a little golden goddess, with her still, jet black hair piled high on
her head, two bangs falling down the side of her cheeks. Her pert
little breasts seem bigger than ever in contrast with her now tiny
waist which he thought he could circle with one hand.<br><br>Chandie
had grown more beautiful too, if that was possible. Like all the
others, she was darker, her dark brown skin as awe inspiring in it's
own distinctive perfection as Feifong's yellow complexion. She had
disassembled her dread-locks, and now wore her hair in a big afro. <br><br>Damian
had grown up with a crush on the afro-ed Angela Davis. Thought she was
the most beautiful woman in the world when he saw her in an old
magazine. Chandie was darker than the young Angela Davis, and her
facial features were slightly more symmetrically in tune; her African
nose sat in the middle of her face in tightly measured position to her
similarly, precisely placed, full lips. Her eyes were large, with
naturally thick, long lashes. Her ears were small, close to her head.
Her face was round, her cheeks dimpled, with bones that were just high
enough to give the illusion that there was some angularity in her face.
She looked liked a living doll, eternally youthful and flawless.<br>
<br>
He didn't know how much it was still bothering her--if at all--but she still wasn't getting any noticeably older in the face. <br><br>He
thought Chandie was more beautiful than any of the women, but he knew
that his opinion was biased, and Janet--Janet was the next step up in
evolution from the already gorgeous to new and improved drop dead
dazzling.<br><br>Sheree was more beautiful too. She was the oldest of
the women, but she was Chandie's aunt; two, or three shades lighter in
complexion than Chandie, but it was clear in her face and form that
beauty and agelessness ran in that family.<br><br>As Damian thoughts
formed around female beauty, because of how particularly pretty Feifong
looked that day in a strapless yellow dress he had never seen before;
the little golden goddess was starting up again with an old song.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"What's wrong with me, Damian?" </font><font color="#000000">She
had come back around mostly, to her original, bold, direct self, but
not fully.&nbsp; Something was missing, unless it was just a show and
was never really there in the first place.</font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"I've told you again and again, there's nothing wrong with you, Fei."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Then how come you don't want me?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Come on, Fei."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"How come Mike doesn't want me anymore?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He couldn't answer that, but he wondered if Mike ever really wanted her, or if he just wanted some kind of fly on his wall.<br><br>She had told him herself of the games they were playing.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What
Mike wants is a crown. Nothing less than that is going to satisfy him
for very long. I'm sorry to say this, Fei, but you need to face up to
some things and stop letting Mike tear you down so much.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"None of them has ever wanted me, Damian."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He had heard this song before too; about all the high-powered men who had used and discarded her. <br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Maybe that's because you never wanted them. You used them as much as they used you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She smiled and looked at him with such adoration, Damian wondered if she heard what he said, or something else.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"How come you understand me so well?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Because you're a first grade, remedial reading course, baby."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">They
both laughed. The two of them had grown very close, and were the kind
of friends that could say anything to each other. And they both knew it.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"What do you think I am, Damian?<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you mean?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"My Nationality. What do you think it is? No one has ever guessed right."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Then I guess I better not say what's on the tip of my tongue."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"What's that?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I was going to say the obvious, or the easiest."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"And that <i>is</i>, mister?" </font><font color="#000000">She put her hand on her slim waist and rolled her neck at him</font><font color="#8000ff">. <br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I <i>was</i> going to say Chinese, but now I'm going to officially say, Korean."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She shook her head. She wasn't mixed-race--at least she didn't appear to be--so he didn't think she was going there.<br>He knew there were other choices but his mind was suddenly blank.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"It's like the people in the United States, has forgotten we existed, or has wiped us from their minds."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She laughed bitterly. <br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"At one time we were the <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> thing on their minds"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She
was Vietnamese. How could he not think of it? That should have been his
choice after Chinese, except if the little he knew of East Asian names
were correct, she had a Chinese--maybe Korean, surname.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Vietnamese."</font><font color="#000000"> He said.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"You still get an eff." You don't get that many choices in a ladies' boutique.<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She looked sad even though she was smiling. <br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"You know what I remember most about my life in Vietnam?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She flirted with him a lot. But that moment was the only time he'd ever felt like holding her in his arms. <br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"I
remember the big ugly scars on my mother's back. They were horrible,
and everyday that my mother lived she left a piece of herself on the
bed sheets. Not a night ever passed by since I was born, that she
didn't wake me up with her screams of anguish."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She was talking about napalm. He didn't have to ask her to clarify. He knew she was talking about Napalm.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"She was pregnant with me when they bombarded her village."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Feifong trembled, as if the memories had somehow touched her bones with a chill, but she didn't cry.<br><br>Damian leaned toward her but she hugged herself and withdrew into another room even though she hadn't moved an inch.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"The
weird thing is that even though I watched my mother suffer through hell
everyday because of what they came to her Country and did to her, I
never felt any hatred towards them. All I felt, even then, was this
great need to somehow make them love me--to get close to them. There
were still many American men in North Vietnam long after the war, and I
must have slept with every one of them."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She laughed again. Damian heard tears.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Finally, one of them married me as a favor and brought me to the United States--the land of my dreams."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What happened to your mother?"<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"I don't know," </font><font color="#000000">she said softly.</font><font color="#8000ff">
"In the beginning I wrote her everyday, and sent her money every
Friday. She never wrote me back. The checks were cashed but I don't
know if she ever got any of the money. I kept sending them until they
started coming back. But I never went back to Vietnam. And I never
stopped trying to make them love me, even after my husband abused me
for 5 years, and finally left me. "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She suddenly looked like a wide-eyed little girl. </font><font color="#8000ff">"Isn't that strange?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Maybe
you subconsciously thought that if you made them love you they wouldn't
do to you what they did to your mother. Did you have any other family?<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She shook her head. </font><font color="#8000ff">"It was just me and mother."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"You were alone in the world, except for a mother whose very existence terrified you everyday."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"She nodded her head. </font><font color="#8000ff">"Yes."</font><font color="#000000"> For the first time since he'd known her, she cried.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Fei..."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She looked up at him.<br><br>He walked up to her and gently wiped her nose for her.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You remember the first day, we met? You actually had me back on my heels. I was scared of you. Where did that come from?"<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"It
comes from me trying to be loved. I would have done anything for it;
become anything. I'm both an actor and a chameleon, and always have
been."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What you are is the epitome
of strength. When we write that dictionary, we're going to put your
picture beside the word survivor."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"
At some point you get tired of surviving. Sometimes you want to stop
surviving and just live, even if for only five minutes. That's why I
married Mike and joined him in this, after only knowing him for two
months. He never told me he loved me, even at the ceremony, but he gave
me a ring, and at that point in my life, I would have given myself to
King Kong for a banana."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"If the world was as it should be, kingdoms wouldn't be enough to win you."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Stop it."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I mean that."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Then why won't you sleep with me?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Because I love you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She fell silent, before saying:<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Strangely enough, I understand that, but I can handle just getting sex from you."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Can you?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">It came out as a whisper. </font><font color="#8000ff">"No."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian reached out and squeezed her right arm.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You know what Chandie told me?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She rolled her eyes at him.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"<span style="font-style: italic;">What?</span>"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"That soon we are going to meet some other Survivors."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"How does she know...tossing bones again?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He warned her with a look.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Seems that someone, or some, <i>them</i>, has been in our cookie jar, and they are just a few days ahead of us." <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></div></div><font size="4"><font color="#800080">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden">
