<div align="left"><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
was sitting in his cubicle poring over his preparation list. Later 
today everybody is supposed meet in the Lab for one last thorough
briefing before they begin their genesis. </font></font></font><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Sheree
called earlier and told him he had his Rootswoman. That was a great
load off his mind. Nothing will work out without the skills and
knowledge of such a person. </font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
had put himself through a cram course on the medicinal and nutritional
values of the earth's vegetation but he couldn't even begin to remember
all the different kinds of plants, much less tell the difference
between all those that looked so similar, yet were so very different in
their usefulness. Plus, the earth's vegetation will be mutating and
changing, like the earth itself. They needed someone who was born with
the knowledge, not someone who learned in school.<br>
What they were getting into was for the long haul--all the stakes-- and
the rootswoman is going to most important element in&nbsp; the
difference between living and dying. 

</font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Sheree
said the Rootswoman name is Chandra and that she is twenty-six years
old. That was another pleasant surprise. He had always envisioned an
accomplished Rootswoman as older, and that was a point for concern.
Their journey was going to be very hard and physically taxing. Most
people don't take too long to get into shape when they have to exert
themselves everyday just to survive but it was still a blessing that
their medicine woman is so young. </font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">There
was a polite knock on Damian's cubicle window. He turned to see the
 Englishman standing there looking like a propped up cadaver. The
 fair-haired man was finally out of his lab coat, dressed in a three
piece suit that hung on him like he had shrunk inside of it to almost
half his original size although he still manage to stand up straight so
the pants didn't bunch up atop his shoes.</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Come on in, Rhoady."</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
didn't see the wolfhead cane until the man slowly advanced forward;
moving so gingerly, with such concentration, Damian all but felt his
agony. </font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><i>What the hell does he keep hobbling to the lab for, everyday?</i> 

</font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian knew Rhoady had a wife and at least one child but the man had never introduced his family to him. 

</font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Rhoady made it inside the cubicle and stood there shaking and swaying, breathing like he had just sprinted 50 yards.</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">"Damian...sir" </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The man had never looked at him so directly and smirk-less.</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">"I must ask of you, a most imposing favor."</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Just name it, Rhoady."</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">"I want you to take my daughter--my only child."</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"What's
so imposing about that Rhoady? We've worked together for three years.
You know you didn't have to come to me like a beggar to ask that.
You've earned a place for your daughter, or anybody else you choose,
with anything the McCloud's research group, does. We are a team." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly Damian felt the usual annoyance he always felt around the man</font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">.</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">"You don't understand." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Rhoady
moved closer to Damian, staring at him like he wanted to get even
closer--into Damian's skin, which left Damian with a very strange
feeling because since they've met, the Englishman had acted like
getting too close would cause something deadly to rub off on him.</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">"I want you to <i>take</i>
her. Marry her. Concubine her if you can't do that. Just make her your
woman. I've given her some of the balm and protected her all these
years...she's very strong."</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Rhoady
began to cough and cry like he was going to project everything inside
his body right there on the floor of Damian's Cubicle. </font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
stood up, undecided what to do. His initial impulse was to go to the
man, help him to sit, or lie down but there was a strong revulsion at
the thought of being puked on by the guy that he had never felt before
with any of the other dying people he had comforted in their last
moments. </font></font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
stood there and before he could move, Rhoady suddenly launched himself
at him-- wrapped himself around Damian like a second skin.</font> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">" I don't want to die." The Englishman's skeletal frame rattled with steadily fainter sobs</font> 

</font></font></p><p>
