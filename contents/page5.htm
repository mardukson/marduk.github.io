<div align="left"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Doctor told me I
had cancer today. Say it's the worse kind you can get...that kind that
just spreads all up inside you like a gasoline fire. Say he don't have
the resources or time to give to a case like mine. I know that we going
through a crisis and everything but he could have used some kind of
tact. </font></font><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Gave me the number of some
Rootswoman. Talkin' 'bout she could make my passage more comfortable.
Aint no Doctor but a Negro is that foolish. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I'm a Christian. I don't know where he gets off trying to get me involved in that voodoo mess. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I aint had no cancer two
months ago and the TV say it was white-skinned people who got that mess
from the breach. Doctor say I got it because I'm light-skinned and I
was outside when that mess happened. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Lord have mercy! What is my baby going to do? 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I'm all the parent he got. I gotta stop crying before he gets home. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">But I aint been able to stop all day. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">That boy is going to school
in Boston in a few months. Praise the Lord. Them schools been after
that child like they done lost their minds. Phone never stops ringing.
Coming over here trying to bribe somebody. I told them Damian is going
to Harvard but they still keep calling and begging, worrying somebody
to death. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">People from Harvard done
sent body guards over here. Two big old, bull necked Dummies hanging
round my house like some kind of mafia. If everything wasn't so tore up
and crazy, I wouldn't stand for that mess. It's more like they
shot-gunning my son than wooing him. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I don't know how long I can
keep Damian from just skipping school altogether. He's already got all
kinds of companies offering him jobs. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Tickle me to death; boy out
there yesterday in all that heat about to fight them big ol' men.
Talkin' 'bout get out from the front of his house. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I gotta get Damian in Boston before he gets fed up with me and them schools. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Talked to Sheree again
yesterday. She promised she'll look after my son for me. That's why I
want him to go to Harvard. It'll be the best thing for him and Sheree. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I guess I'll wait until
Damian gets settled in school to tell Sheree the bad news about my
illness. I don't want that heffa feeling sorry for me. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">When she finds out what
I've been blessed to raise these 17 years, she's gonna know if I drop
dead tomorrow, aint nobody gotta feel sorry for me. I might not have
traveled the world or lived in luxury but the Lord has blessed me like
nobody's business and I know Sheree is gonna see when she gets to know
Damian, that her life aint been no ways better than mine. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I'm tired. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Damian always wanted to go
to the University of Richmond, so he could be close to home. But that
boy don't belong in no school but the best. That's why I can't tell him
about my illness yet. I wouldn't be able to get his narrow behind out
the house then. That boy is something else 'bout his mama. But he don't
belong to me. My sister had him and his race owns him. Some big people
have been after that boy since he was fourteen years old, but my son
belongs to his people. I've never told him nothing like that. But I
never felt I had to. Damian is always telling me stuff like Jesus is
black. Always talking 'bout Egyptians and people lying 'bout history. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I know he think I don't
hear him, and to tell the truth, for a long time I hated to hear that
stuff. I didn't believe none of it. I thought Damian was being what
they called Afro-centric just out of rebellion. I know that boy don't
lie though, and he don't pretend. He's definitely smart enough to know
what he's talking about. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Lord, I'm so tired. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Maybe Jesus <i>is</i> black. I don't know. I've never pictured him like that. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">But some things make you wonder. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Like how everything is
dying now all at once. Lord knows aint no Black People did enough
damage to this world to threaten the existence of nothing. Damian said
the black people been on this earth a million years. In all that time
we aint killed nothing. Now the trees, fish, animals, people, air, and
everything else is dying off for good. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Why cant Jesus be black? 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">My son is black and he's the best thing in this life that I know.
