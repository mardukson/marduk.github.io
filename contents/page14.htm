Maguthaba urged him onward, the mind was willing, but the flesh finally
sat down on the curb and drenched itself in sweat. His shoulders were
so slumped and resigned, Maguthaba knew it was pointless to goad the

sighed and wiped his forehead. It was only 50 meters from the car to
the lab but the guy just couldn't make it. He tried. Maguthaba just
wished he had tried 5 meters harder because, now, he was going to have
to get the poor fellow out of the sun before he drowned in his bodily

the cool safety of the Lab. Then he looked outside and saw the heat
bouncing off the hood of his car. He saw the asphalt in the parking lot
boiling and buckling like the beginning of a major earthquake and
thought why did he bother. </font></font></font></p><p>
