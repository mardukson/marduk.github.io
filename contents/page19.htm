was down to him and Jubatta now. All the old white scientists who came
to work with him have died. He still had a bunch of assistants, most of
them black African, but all the world renowned Researchers were gone.<br>
<br>
Jubatta was as smart as they come, and had long been a tremendous help
to him--more than capable of heading his own research team. If the fat
man was nothing else, he was loyal. He was also a good friend. The best
friend Maguthaba ever had. </font></font><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He
received a call from the United States. A kid name Damian Marson. He'd
read about the boy, picked up the book the young scientist wrote when
he was just fifteen years old. That's why he was even considering
accepting the boy's invitation to come to the United States. That was
some seriously insightful writing on biology and environment. He wanted
to meet the youngster. That, and get the chance to see old Douglas
McCloud again. </font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">The
problem is: Jubatta will never survive a flight to the United States.
He couldn't even walk anymore; lived in the lab these days. </font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He had been watching his friend slowly die since that day he had pulled him out of the heat. </font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Jubatta wasn't just heat exhausted that day. He had suffered a stroke. And <i>he</i>
never even knew it;had tugged and pulled at his friend like he was some
kind of willfully stubborn mule. The fact was, Jubatta truly couldn't
walk, yet for him--because he kept pushing him--he had struggled to
hobble those five meters with only 5% of the needed blood pumping from
his heart. </font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">How
could he leave to go to the United States knowing Jubatta will be dead
before he gets back? But on the other hand, how can he pass up this
opportunity to help with a breakthrough on the breach problem? The
youngster Damian spoke of some possible solution McCloud had discovered
regarding a plant that could not only kill cancerous cells without
harming healthy ones, the balm can also help the body maintain its
natural temperature in up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Maguthaba looked
over at Jubatta. As normally these days, the fat man was asleep.
Maguthaba stood up and started pacing the floor. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">" I've researched your dilemma, MugUdu" </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Maguthaba, startled, stopped pacing and turned to his friend. Forget that he thought Jubatta was asleep, <i>when</i> did <span style="font-style: italic;">he</span> do any research? He hadn't been awake for more than ten minutes at a stretch, in over a month. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"And my conclusion is that you should go." </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"What are you talking about, Jubatta?" </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"I heard you on the phone. All the data comparisons say you should go." </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"I can't." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Maguthaba shook his head</font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Why not?" </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"Because you cannot travel and I am afraid to leave you for so long." </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The fat man's smile radiated so much gratitude, tears threatened to well up in Maguthaba's eyes. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Have
you forgotten my thorough excellence so soon MugUdu? I have factored in
that equation and the conclusion is still overwhelmingly that you
should go to meet this young one, named Damian." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The fat man's eyelids drooped; his head was slowly falling to his chest. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">"</font><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">MugUdu...go...father...go...<i>go!</i>"</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
fat man's head dropped, like Maguthaba had seen it do a thousand times,
only this time, the loud, labored snoring did not follow. Maguthaba saw
his friend's body relax and extract like he'd seen too many others do
over the past few years and he knew there was no more Jubatta to be
concerned with. He lit a candle and called on Jubatta's most righteous
Ancestor to come and show his spirit the way home. He next called the
lab's medical wing. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Later that week, he packed for the long journey to the United States. </font></font></font></p><p><!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></p></div><div></div><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden"> </font></font></font><div></div><!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--></body></html>
