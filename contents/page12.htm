o' why did I fuck that boy? And that's what I did. I fucked him. Pure
selfishness on my part.&nbsp;</font></font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">I
should have given more consideration to what was going to happen to
Damian's feelings afterward... and I don't know why I didn't. I love
that child, and I knew I wasn't going to carry on any love affair with
a man, much less my 18 year old godson.</font></font><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Then
again, I never dreamed he would develop an infatuation with me. He's so
handsome and charismatic--I see the way all these young, beautiful
girls act around him. Why would he need a romantic relationship with an
old woman like me?<br>
 </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Goddammit!
Life doesn't throw anything but rotten eggs anymore. It's like some
evil god has decided to go all out before the ride is over. At least I
hope that one day soon it will be over because the world has become too
much a parody of hell to stomach for much longer. It's sooo hot and
even the slightest relief from constant pain that you try to grab
always blows up into a bigger source of pain and stress. I had all
these lovers but if I wasn't so lonely and empty, I would never have
fucked Damian. They gave me nothing--just sucked out of me what little
force of life I did have inside me. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">I'm
through taking and I'm through giving. From now on I'm an Island and I
don't give a goddamned if I can be one or not. I'm through hurting
people and I'm through letting people hurt me. The only way to end it,
is to close up. I'm here for Damian--to support my Letta's baby and his
work--but It's <i>all </i>I have to give anymore.
