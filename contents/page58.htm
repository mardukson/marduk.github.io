</p><div align="left"><font size="5"><font size="4">It was his third
reconnaissance trip to the slave compound in three days and he had yet
to see a single white man. He saw the Native Enforcers, cracking their
whips and yelling, but he saw none of their masters. <br><br>He couldn't understand it. Did the British soldiers just go away? <br><br>Then it dawned on him.<br><br>It
was late in the day when he saw the white men that first time. Maybe
they only came out at night, or, when the sun was low in the sky.<br><br>This
time, he settled in for a long wait instead of going back to camp. Six
hours later, the white men emerged. He counted sixty-five of them. Most
of them had Native women standing beside them. Some of the women had
infants in their arms.<br><br>They were all tall, with light hair and
pale faces--not the pale faces his forefathers talked about, but pale
like one of those glowing white masks mime actors wore sometimes. He
didn't remember them looking like that the first time he saw them. Were
the changes in the earth affecting them that drastically? They looked
weaker too, than they did to him the first time he saw them, but the
arrogance they exuded in the way they moved, held their heads, and
looked at the Natives was more evident than ever. They were growing
into their roles as gods over these people.<br><br>All the Natives were sitting on the ground in rows. There were about 300 of them and each of them had their heads bowed.<br><br><font color="#808000">" You!" <font color="#000000">Chako
saw one of the Enforcers pointing the handle of his whip at an old man
in the first row. A woman screamed "Nooooo!" A tall, skinny Enforcer
ran up to her and starting whaling at her with his whip as if he was
attempting to kill her. <font color="#808000"><br><font color="#000000"><br><font color="#0000ff">"That's enough!"</font><font color="#000000"> One of the white men put up his hand. The Enforcer stopped in midstroke and stepped back.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The old man stood up. <br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">" What the fuck did you call him for, Kaffir?"</font><font color="#000000"> One of the younger British soldiers said. </font><font color="#8000ff">"He's too goddamn old."</font><font color="#000000"> He pointed his spear towards the group of Natives. </font><font color="#8000ff">" Bring her up."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br><br></font><font color="#804040">" No!..No!" </font><font color="#000000">Hands reached up to hold the old man down. </font><font color="#804040">"Yuh nuh gwan drink mi Dawta!..You nuh gwan drink mi Dawta. " </font><font color="#000000">The old man wailed.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0080">"Hush father, fore dey bun yuh too." </font><font color="#000000">A strong woman--one of the six rebel women--put her hand over his mouth as she whispered in the old man's ear.</font><font color="#ff0080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Two
Enforcers moved into the crowd and started dragging the screaming woman
into the clearing between the white men and the crowd of natives.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Faddah!...hep mi, Faddah!"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The Enforcers began tying the young woman's arms and feet.<br><br>Chako
crouched hidden, watching, as the Enforcers lifted the woman and
carried her to a pole. They turned her upside down, pressed her against
the pole and began to wrap rope around her legs. An old woman walked up
carrying a large silver bowl. She put it beneath the bound girl's head.<br><br>A
fat man, clearly native, judging by his facial features, but with his
face and upper body painted as white as the Soldiers, approached the
scene. He was carrying a gleaming machete. <br><br>That's when Chako
Morningsky raised his bow. It took every ounce of will he possessed not
to let the arrow fly. He lowered the bow and turned, started running as
quietly and swiftly as a wolf.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div></div><font size="5"><font size="4"><font color="#808000"><font color="#000000"><font color="#808000"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden">
