<div align="left"><font size="4">When they left the slave Island,
Elizabeth was with them. She didn't want to part from Sheree and she
could no longer stomach the idea of spending the rest of her life on
the Island where she had been so terrorized.<br><br>All the
"ghouls"(Steve's word) were executed. In the end Damian decided to let
the Islanders do it, so they would realize their own strength and stop
being so superstitious, passive and in awe of everything that was
different from themselves.<br><br>The thirty-five men were all hung by the neck from the same pole they beheaded the young woman on.<br><br>The
strong woman, who had hushed the old man, stood up to take a leadership
role. Her name was Harriet. She officiated over the executions with
relish. All the other Natives cheered each time the box the condemned
men stood on, was kicked away from under them. Under the exhortations
of Harriet, some of them grabbed spears and ran up on the corpses in a
fury.<br><br>Damian talked to the old man whose daughter had been
crucified and bled. He was an exalted Elder. The old man assured Damian
that the soldier's Mistresses and their infants were considered valued
members of the community and were in no danger.<br><br>And so Damian and his crew loaded up the boat and left the Island and its people behind.<br><br>***************<br><br>They
had named the schooner "Liberty." She was a magnificent piece of design
and workmanship. Damian was more and more pleased with her each time he
lifted her anchor. He thought she would do well when he helped pick her
out, but the lean little vessel was weathering the test of time and
action like it was getting better and stronger from the wash of the
ocean.<br><br>They have still yet to hoist her sails. She was still
knifing through the water like an Olympics swimming champ. They were
now adrift aboard the Liberty again.<br><br>They were heading back to the Island of Trinidad to get their two friends. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></div>
