</font></font></font><p><font size="5"><font color="#ff8000"><font size="4"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Damian listened till Jane finished speaking. He turned to Steve.</span>

</font></font></font></p><p></p><font size="5"><font color="#ff8000"><font size="4"><font color="#800080">"How far away is the next Island?</font><font color="#000000">"<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"At our current pace, we should reach the West Indies in about six days."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Jane, how long can we stretch what we have?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Three...four more days, if we ration."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The
big Cat was sitting up on her haunches, between Chandra and the Iowees,
head up, like she was the chairman of the board or some equally
important thing.<br>Steve looked over at her. A devilish gleam suddenly leaped into his pupils.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"If push comes the shove, we can always barbecue. I've heard that tiger meat tastes just like chicken."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Sheree, who was sitting to the left of Steve, exploded with laughter. She punched his arm.<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Stop it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The big cat blinked and yawned. The Iowees were cooing and rubbing her coat.<br><br>Damian cursed. </font><font color="#800080">"That's at least three days with no food. I thought we calc'ed for the sea mist's possible effect on our food supply." </font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#000040">He gave Steve a look</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#800080">.</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#008080">"We did." </font><font color="#000000">Steve shrugged, his tone clearly saying lighten up. </font><font color="#008080">"But
we don't know this new world we're in yet Boss. Everything we've ever
known about our environment before the breach gets tossed out the
window."<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"What's the big deal? Three days without a meal isn't going to kill anyone." </font><font color="#000000">Bruce said.</font><font color="#800040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve puffed out his left cheek like Marlon Brando, in the classic movie, " The Godfather." </font><font color="#008080">"How
can I 'splain this to youse Bruce. It's a Scientist thing. Youse see,
we Scientists don' likea suprises. Yew unnastand what I'ma saying to
youse, Brucie?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian felt he was being mocked, even though he knew Steve was just being Steve.<br><br></font><font color="#808000">" I like the barbecue idea myself."</font><font color="#000000"> Patrick laughed. </font><font color="#808000">" We've been eating so many leaves, I'm starting to shit green."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">" It's not leaves."</font><font color="#000000"> Jane said sharply. </font><font color="#ff8000">" And don't curse in council."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Yes Mommy."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"You're asking for it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chako snickered. </font><font color="#004000">"I think you better stop digging, Midnite, while your ears are still above ground."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yuh tink inyone is still alive dere?"</font><font color="#000000"> Chandra asked Damian. </font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian
heard strain in her voice and the only reason for it that he could
think of, was that her Father's relatives had lived on one of the West
Indie Islands.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" No, baby." <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He sent her waves of compassion with his silent emissions to her. </span>"I don't think so."</font><font color="#000000"> He turned from her finally,&nbsp; and addressed the entire group:</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">" I'm sorry about the food situation."<br><br></font><font color="#008080">" Why is that your fault, boss? You have nothing to apologize for."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" I guess you're right, Steve. It's not my fault. It's <i>yours</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span>
fault. It's our job to handle the logistics of surviving. We just can't
afford to make these kinds of simple mistakes. What if we were in a
stretch where the nearest land mass was weeks, or months away?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve thought for a moment. </font><font color="#008080">"
I don't know...go fishing, maybe? I get your point, but I still say we
had no way of knowing that the sea mist would spoil the food supply so
fast."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Could
we had done a sample test before we left, or not, Steve? We made a
potentially, grave mistake. And it was one that could have been easily
avoided. I'm not saying that it's possible to think of everything, but
we can at least own up to our mistakes without qualifications. That's
the only way we'll keep on our toes."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve stood up.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Oh, now you're going to walk off in a huff as usual."<br><br></font><font color="#008080">" No, I'm going to walk off in my skin. I can't argue with you, Damian."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Admit that you're wrong, Steve." </font><font color="#000000">Damian
felt like something was tearing away from his insides. He couldn't let
Steve walk away from him angry, but he couldn't bring himself to give
an inch either.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080">" I would if I was."</font><font color="#000000">
Steve seemed reluctant to walk away too. But he was as stubborn as
Damian. Both wanted desperately, to patch things up. They had never
argued before. But neither knew how.</font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"You're both right. And you're both wrong."</font><font color="#000000"> Sheree said. </font><font color="#ff00ff">"Steve...sit."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The big man looked at her, one brow raised.<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"<i>Sit</i>."</font><font color="#000000"> Sheree patted the spot beside her.</font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>He obeyed, but mainly because he wanted to anyway. He sat there with his arms folded.<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Damian, look at Steve." </font><font color="#000000">Sheree
was the Elder in their group, and more and more she was conducting
herself like someone who will one day have that exalted position which
was once so cherished by Aboriginal peoples.</font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"What do you see?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" I see a big assed, long haired man with his arms folded."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">" That's right, you see a <i>man</i>.
A man that has proven his friendship, and&nbsp; love for you, and for
all of us, over and over again. So why would you chastise him like he
was a child in front of everyone?"<br><br></font><font color="#808000">" Maybe for the same reason <i>he</i> felt he could talk to Janie like he did."</font><font color="#000000"> Patrick groused.</font><font color="#808000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Jane's face instantly turned beet red.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Look Patrick, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't keep using me to moan over <i>your</i> injured manhood. He was talking to me and we're not sewn together. I'm okay with what Steve said, <i>alright</i>?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" You're right."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian stood up.</font><font color="#800080"> " I don't know what the hell got into me." </font><font color="#000000">He walked past Sheree, over to face Steve. He looked directly into the big man's eyes. </font><font color="#800080">"A
man save your life one time, and he earns enough respect to last an
eternity. When he does it over and over again, at the risk of his own,
you <i>never </i>get so high and mighty--even in your mind-- that you talk down to him. I'm sorry Steve."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The big man lurched to his feet. Damian hugged him and Steve hugged Damian back. The two men separated.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"I was wrong, Boss."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Let's not go through <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> again."</font><font color="#000000"> Sheree said hastily.</font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080">"Janie."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane looked up at Steve.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">" I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The love she&nbsp; had for him was suddenly shining in her eyes.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"
I understand what you were feeling Steve. I didn't cry because of the
way you spoke to me. I cried because I heard what you said."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The
big cat walked over and wedged herself in between Damian and Steve. And
as all eyes were suddenly trained on her, she yawned.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></font></font></div></div><font size="5"><font color="#ff8000"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden">
