</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">He had driven the short
distance to his lab, cursing and sweating the entire way. The AC in his
spanking new Lexus had fizzled out the day before like a two dollar
electric tooth brush. He only had to drive a few blocks. Still, his new
car was literally falling apart, inside and out, under the relentless
heat. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">It was coming. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The scientific community has long been aware of that, but 165 degrees, in the middle of the cool season? 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Maguthaba, 6ft 6inches
tall, 250 pounds, wire rimmed glasses, closely cropped black hair, sat
in his office poring over the data his team had accumulated. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The entire world,
Scientific community has been monitoring this alarming phenomenon with
the kind of gravity usually reserved for universally threatening
diseases. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The data showed clear
evidence that the earth was losing its protective shield from the sun.
He expected a continued acceleration of that damage with each passing
year but the trend of the past few weeks were so beyond even his most
pessimistic projection, Maguthaba, hadn't slept in days from worry over
it. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">One hundred sixty-five
degrees and climbing today. Yesterday it was one hundred and fifty, the
day before-- 160 degrees. Over at least 120 degrees every day for
nearly a month. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">He thought they had more time. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">He had his team working
24/7 shifts. He had been confident that given time they will come up
with some kind of solution to the looming threat facing WoMankind--if
not his guys,-- other Scientists around the world, who were working
just as desperately. But this sudden sustained spike...It had to be the
heavy bombs the Americans dropped on Iraq. They were warned the ozone
layer couldn't take anymore rents from the heat and particles those
kinds of explosions sent up. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Everything has suddenly changed from alarming, to critical. All the projections and timetables, rendered meaningless. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The first thing he have to
do is affirm his decision with the entire world body of scientists. A
joint communicable has to be released.&nbsp; All&nbsp; the governments
of the world must do what no one really wants to. They all have to
issue nationwide alerts and inform their people--tell them what
precautions to take--not tomorrow but today! </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Maguthaba reached for the
phone on his desk. Just as his hand grasped it, a light--bursting
through the full length picture window of his high-rise office, which
faced the street overlooking the city, struck him full force--like some
kind of scalar weapon. The last thing that he remembered before he
passed out, was the terrifying blackness before his wide open eyes as
he tried numbly and foolishly, to see what had hit him.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></p></div>
