<div align="left"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I Wish Ma had let me go to school at U of R. 

</font></font><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I
talked to Mr. McCloud and he's an alright dude. I understand what he's
about, and I appreciate that he's not trying to front about what I am
to him. Like every other decent Scientist, I plan to dedicate my life
to solving the breach problem. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">But at
the moment my main concern is ma. She looked bad when I left home and
there isn't anybody there to look after her. If she hadn't started
crying so hard, there's no way that I'd be a thousand miles away from
her right now. I could do lab work at U of R. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Ma has always been determined as hell to send me to Boston. I guess it's because my godmother is a Professor here. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I
swear if mama don't start sounding better my ass is going home.&nbsp; I
just got here three days ago but I'm going back to Richmond this
weekend to check up on ma. She sounded like a hundred years old last
night. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Light-skinned people like her are falling off like crazy. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Some parts of the Country are still struggling to get all the bodies buried. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Mr. McCloud is right about what's my responsibility but that old dude don't know anything <i>but</i> that, if he thinks I'm not going to be at my ma's side if she's dying. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Professor
Fontaine--my godmother--says if I decide to transfer schools, she'll
resign and leave with me. She's coming with me this weekend, too. We'll
decide then what we're going to do. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Until three days ago I haven't seen Sheree--she insists that I call her that--in years. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Already
she's living up to what she calls the "honor" ma has bestowed upon her.
She's even invited me to move in with her but I don't know. Mr. McCloud
has already rented me a nice place to stay. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I
haven't seen that many melanin chicks around here but the ones I have
peeped are off the beaufukking scale. If I stay in Boston I'm going to
have to have me some privacy. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Must
be something in the water up here because my godmother is like, whoa,
too. She and ma are the same age but they don't look like they've been
eating the same kinds of food. She looks like ma's little Sister.
Smells like something made to beautify heaven. She's always up under me
too; like she don't have a life or something. Fine as she is, I still
haven't seen a man looking like he might be getting into her yet. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Man,
this place is Trump. Wonder what it's costing the School? I know they
have got to be breaking some rules putting me up in a joint like
this. Then again, I guess after what happened with the ozone breach, a
lot of rules are being broken. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I hope
Sheree don't come over here again tonight. My girl and I are over and
lonely as I feel, I don't need anything looking and smelling like her
around me right now. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Plus,
the way she's always lighting up when she sees me, I'm starting to get
ideas no Kat should be getting about any kind of mom of his. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I'll be glad when Friday gets here. I'm lonely, bored and worried as hell. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">I guess I'll carry my ass to bed. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">But first I'm going to call Ma one more time.
