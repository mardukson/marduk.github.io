liked the bookish soldier and since coming to know him, he really
enjoyed Lee's extensive knowledge, his stories, and his
enthusiastic--sometime comical way of telling them.<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"I
do too...kind of strange how the same people who can sign up to
possibly face bullets and bombs everyday, can be so phobic about
certain other things."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I wonder if
it's as much phobia, as it is lack of control. On the wide waters
without an engine, the sea really has the ultimate control. There's
nothing to strike back at when things go wrong. "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee nodded. </font><font color="#804040">"You're right about that, Damian. For people like us--military people--control is a very big thing."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Tell
me something Lee...where are you from? Where I come from we didn't join
the military and when some of us did, it was only for lack of another
alternative."</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"I'm
from Minnesota. I'm one of those who joined the military for economic
reasons. My intentions were to get in and get out as soon as I
qualified for the GI bill. But while I was in the military I traveled
the world, saw what it's like everywhere...and let me tell you
something Damian; there's nowhere to run to get away from evil and
injustice. I know why you hated the U.S. government and its military,
but I don't think<i> you</i> do."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you mean? I know exactly why I hated them."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Oh, you mean the aggression, the small scale genocides, the meddling in other Nation's affairs, the economical robbery."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Yeah, that, among a long list of other things."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Is
that stuff the real cause of your hatred Damian, or was it the
pretensions? If the United States had stopped lying about what it was,
and had gone ahead and let the world and its people know that it was a
ruthless Empire that fed off the blood, sweat and tears of the Nations
of the world because it simply could not have survived any other way,
would you have hated it anymore than say--the Egyptian, or the Roman,
or the British, or the Arabian or the Atlantean, or the Assyrian, or
the Meroe, or Soviet, or any other empire? Would you have hated it, or
would you have just accepted it for what it was, and started making
choices?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you mean; making choices?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Before
the breach, you had to plant roots somewhere, Damian. Like I said;
there's was no Garden of Eden on earth. So what do you do? Wander the
world like a Gypsy--give evil all the cards, or do you find yourself a
spot to settle in, and try to fight to even the odds some on behalf of
the little bit of good that is in the world? <br>There are two
opposing factions in this world and seemingly in this universe. There's
a freedom faction and a slavery faction. Always have been, and always
will be. The two factions have been struggling for control since the
dawning of time." </font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Lee
liked to talk. And Damian liked to listen. They will be parting ways in
the morning, so Damian was delighted when he saw Lee get into that
comfortable position that meant he was ready for a long conversation.
He was going to miss these times with the worldly soldier.<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Take my nemesis Tony and the Iowees, for example," </font><font color="#000000">Lee said,</font><font color="#804040"> "their mission is to keep the Iowees alive so they can be bred like chickens or cows for a role of eternal slavery.<br>
</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size="4"><font color="#800080"><font color="#804040"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So Steve </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">was</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> right, Damian thought.</span><br>
</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size="4"><font color="#800080"><font color="#804040">Our orders were to liberate the Iowees--kill them if we had to. <br><br>Two
years before the breach, we engaged Tony and his unit in the badlands
of South Dakota, and took the Iowees. In the time we had them we all
fell in love with the little Scamps, so killing them was off the table
for us despite our contingency orders. That's why three years later
Tony's unit was able to take the Iowees back from us.<br>Our mission
was to survive the breach and if possible save the Iowees. The latter
was not a priority. There are only two of them, but we all wanted them
to be able to live out their lives.<br>When we had the Iowees, we no
more wanted them caged and enslaved in the present than we did in the
future. They delighted so much in running free in the grass and
frolicking among the flowers and trees, we began to let them. It had
been so long since we've seen any signs of the Drakes--that's Tony's
unit--we thought maybe they had succumbed to the breach, though we
should have known better. They had everything to survive that we had.
We forgot security and caution--everything we've been taught--and we
paid dearly for it. <br><br>One day they came and snatched the Iowees.<br><br>Over
half of us died because we were more concerned about the Iowees than
our own people and lives. If we had just killed the Iowees to prevent
them from falling in enemy hands we would have easily won that battle.
Instead we fought for them, with one hand tied behind our backs because
the Drakes, were using the Iowees as a shield as they made their
retreat. Obviously they had us under surveillance for some time. All
this occurred before the breach caused everything mechanical to stop
working. They gambled that we wouldn't be able to shoot the Iowees, and
they won."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">When Lee paused, Damian asked:<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"How useful a slave can such small Beings be, now, or in the future?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">They
were bred to be small, so they could be easily dominated physically and
controlled. They were also bred to be docile, happy, loving, passive
and content with any situation. That's why they are so easy to fall in
love with. They are totally without guile--like small children.<br>Eventually,
they would have been bred with other people--maybe even you and your
group. The word around then, was that some Civs were going to be given
the balm so they could survive the breach.</font>"<br><br><font color="#000000"><i>So the balm--like the software came from the Government. Now you know the answers to your questions Damian.<br><br></i></font><font color="#800080">"Lee, you ever hear the name, Douglas McCloud, in your circles?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Sure.
He was at Harvard, wasn't he--with you? Look Damian; don't get bent out
of shape about this. Every major scientist, or Lab worked with the
Pentagon. The government had the money, but a lot of the ideas came
from independent Scientists and labs."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"So you think we were helped, so we could survive to breed with the Iowees?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"That
was the talk. And it also makes sense. If the Iowees were bred to be
docile, I doubt if they would have wanted them to breed with warriors.
And it seems, your people were the only ones either faction tried to
save besides their special forces soldiers. "<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Seems
to me that whole thing is more iffy than scientific. What was to ensure
that the descendants of the Iowees and...us Civs, wouldn't have taken
as their dominant traits, the traits of we men and women, instead of
the Iowees? Believe me; we are not docile, or easy to manage. We have a
giant among us for god sakes. And I don't think any of us are going to
develop any romantic attraction to the Iowees, so how was all this
interbreeding supposed to happen?"<br><br><br></font><font color="#804040">"That's
the limitations of this sort of thing and always have been. You might
be able to isolate certain genes to breed into a new life form, such
traits as brawn, beauty, docility, etc, but you can rarely have it all.
Ultimately things still has to be done the old fashioned way. God is
still king and none of Its creatures has been able to take Its crown
yet. As for how they were going to get you people to mate with the
Iowees, you've seen what the Drakes unit is like. They were saved for a
reason too."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">Lee, do you know the myth of Nimrod the mighty hunter.<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The studious soldier nodded. </font><font color="#800000">"yeah."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you think he was doing?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"He
turned the world upside down, Damian. According to the Enuma Elish,
changed the ways of the gods. He snatched the world--its reality, away
from the gods and masters, and claimed it for the slaves.<br><br></font><font color="#000000">That was the way Damian deciphered the story too.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">" </font><font color="#800080">I've
always believed that the ancient Priest who handed down that allegory
meant The Tower of Babel to serve as an euphemism for the rise of
man--the slave--,from a state of bondage, to a position of freedom.</font><font color="#800000"> "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee agreed</font><font color="#800000">.
"And of course the so-called, gods, had to band together and destroy
the tower because the slaves had taken over the plantation. Nothing new
under the sun, Damian. To be free, has always been the ultimate
struggle for man.</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Stories like that is why I got away from revealed religions. "</font><font color="#000000"> Damian said. " </font><font color="#800080">When
you have people interpreting for you all your life what is good or bad,
black or white, right or wrong, it's easy to be induced into accepting
things as <i>they</i> understand them, but when you read it for
yourself, what it actually says, means, you develop a whole different
point of view if you're really trying to see what the message is."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee
reached in his pocket and pulled out a package of cigarettes. He
offered one to Damian who refused it. Lee shrugged and put the pack
back in his pocket.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"I recall a
discussion I had with my big sister, one day. This was back in my angry
militant days when I was looking at the world through a tunnel. She was
talking that bible stuff again. And for some reason I just flew off the
handle. Understand; this was the person who had raised me like her own
child. I knew that everything she did, she did out of love and concern
for me. Times were hard for us. Her life in particular was sadder than
a Greek tragedy and I had never tried to take her crutch from her
before, even though, like you--I stopped hearing what she was talking
about as soon as I learned to comprehend what I read. I knew how much
she needed her beliefs to get her through day by day, but still, one
day I say to her--speaking to her like I was talking to some kind of
enemy:<br>I don't want to hear that shit today, sis. I'm tired of
people like you talking a bunch of bullshit about things you have never
stopped for one second to really think about. Somebody gave you a
poison and y'all passing it down to everybody you love from generation
to generation, and all the while thinking you're going to be rewarded
by the same devils that gave you the poison in the first place.<br><br>I
was a grown man then--about nineteen years old, as tall as I am now.
She was a little thing, blacker than a berry, never had space enough
from stress to form a romantic relationship in her life, never had a
dollar to spare at the end of the week; forty years old, never had a
vacation. All she had was that bible and that church, and that god that
cursed her to the life she lived. <br><br>She was crying, never heard
me talk to her like that before. I felt like shit, watching her, but I
couldn't stop myself, says to her:<br><br>You ever stop to think about
what you read in that book, sis? This guy Noah, you keep saying was so
righteous; what do you read in that book that was good about him? The
book itself tells you what he was, but because some other devils told
our great Granddaddy that Noah and god were pals, we go to our graves
worshiping the head devil of the world.<br><br>I took the bible she
held in her hands and started flipping through it. I used to know the
book like the back of my hands but I couldn't even find the Noah story
anymore even though I used to think he was a righteous man too, saved
me from the flood, had god's own ear and all that. Couldn't find what I
was looking for so I ask her:<br><br>What does it says in there about,
Noah? I still don't know why, all these years later, but for some
reason, it was the most important to me to destroy something that
day--something, I now believed was hurting us and the world--something,
I was afraid to tackle before because I knew how much her beliefs meant
to her.<br>And she answers me, Damian...because you know...she
defending her life here...fighting for all she had...all that was
keeping her sane and coping. She says:<br><br>It says Noah was perfect in his generation.<br><br>And I shoot back:<br><br>And what was Noah's generation known for?<br><br>She
looks at me, eyes brimming. I knew she didn't know what I was getting
at, so I say: Why was Noah on the goddamn boat? Just like that; cussing
at my beautiful big sister, who had never so much as raised her voice
to me.<br><br>Because god sent the flood, she says, like a child--so
shocked by my behavior she couldn't even think. All she could do was
respond like a prisoner under interrogation.<br><br>And I say:<br><br>Why did god send the flood?<br><br>Because all the people were wicked, she says. <br><br>Then I said to her:</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#800000">so the book says Noah was perfect in a generation when <i>everybody </i>was evil and wicked. What does that tell you, Sis? <br><br>I knew she wasn't understanding what I was getting at, so I answered myself:<br><br>It
tells you that in of world full of evil people Noah was the most
perfect of them all-- head devil. And it tells you that same thing over
and over again. The man was a drunkard, he was licentious. He was
hateful, vengeful, vain, cruel, without any natural affection at all.
It wasn't enough for the man to project his evil for a while, or
throughout his lifetime--like a head devil--he had to keep it going for
all eternity. You ever stop to think Sis, what kind of mind would curse
even his worst enemy's children, to an eternity of poverty and slavery?
You ever stop to think about all the shit that goes hand in hand with
slavery? The child rape, the female rape, the male rape, the poverty,
the degradation, the mental and spiritual torment? You ever stop to
think that the way you live--the way most people in this world live--is
exactly the way Noah and his god cursed them to be?<br><br>I saw
something in her snap then, Damian. Most people like her, I have told
this stuff too, had enough survival instinct to just let it go in one
ear and out the other because they knew what they had invested in their
beliefs. But my words stayed with her--probably because they came from
me--the one thing she had in life that she knew loved and cared about
her. And you know." </font><font color="#000000">Lee's voiced choked.</font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000">"
After that day she just died; gave up. Been carrying a mountain on her
shoulders all her life, and because of my selfish need to lash out, she
finally let it crush her. Never opened that bible again. Never went to
church again. I joined the military because I had to support her, and
had no other way to do it. I had sapped her of everything that she had
inside her. And I had no right." </font><font color="#000000">He shook his head.</font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000">"Whether
what I said was true or not, don't mean a blasted thing in the grand
scheme of things. The truth, a lie, a devil, a god, a flag, a pill, a
drink--it don't make a difference what we use to help us make it day by
day through this hellish place--as long as we're not hurting anybody
else--we all have a right to it. And there isn't anybody big enough in
this world to take that away from us. <br><br>I used to think about
all those young kids with their lives and futures ruined, sitting in
jail or prison, because they had a joint in the ash tray or in their
pockets and they were stopped, or patted down by some Drake who--if he
didn't smoke weed himself once in while-- sure as hell drank to get
high. But yet, thought nothing about doing to some black kid what he
would have never wanted done to his own kid--who he knew, was getting
high more than the black kid ever did, or could. I used to think about
that Damian, and I realized those Drakes were me. That's what I did to
my sister. Took her future and put her in hell just because she wanted
a release from constant pain. It just wasn't my goddamn place to be in
that kind of position and have that kind of power over somebody else's
life.<br><br>I learned a life altering lesson that day. I learned to
leave the pied piping shit alone-- to stop trying to tell other people.
To stop preaching, and to stop focusing on people smoking joints,
taking pills, drinking alcohol, worshiping bullshit, or whatever they
indulged in to find release from constant pain. You don't blame the
players for a messed up video game do you? No, you blame the ones who
created the game. I decided to search and find out why there was so
much frantic need to escape in the first place, and then to try and do
something about it. And there <i>is </i>a cause for the pain Damian. The Preachers don't tell you what it is, but all the Prophets and Disciples did."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
still recalled enough from his bible study days to discern what Lee was
referring to but he was a Scientist. He didn't completely dismiss that
kind of thing but even if it was real, he thought it fruitless to even
acknowledge it. You still had to live in the world. He knew from
talking to him over the months that Lee was something more than just an
elite soldier, he was some kind of spiritual warrior. He discovered the
U.S government had those too--just like the Catholic Church used to
during the Middle Ages.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I
understand what you're saying about the Noah hocus-pocus. Reality, to
most people is not what they see with their eyes, or what they discern
with their minds, but what they are told. Didn't one of the Prophets
say that to those people who course and record history, good is evil
and evil is good? So them calling Noah perfect good was really calling
him perfect evil--by their definition."<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Exactly."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee nodded, looking at Damian with renewed respect. </font><font color="#800000"><br>"That's
why you can't base your truths on what those who get to do all the
talking and recording tells you-- you base it on what you see with your
own eyes and understand with your own mind, using your own sense of
Creator-given, morality."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Kind of
how the people controlling the governments of the world were always
talking about freedom, justice and Human rights, while at the same time
being the only real destroyers of people's basic rights and lives. But
by "Human" rights they meant <i>their</i> rights to be happy, free and prosperous, because they didn't consider most people--the poor people of the earth--to be Human. <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee nodded, looking even more impressed.<br><br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Somebody school you, son? That kind of stuff wasn't common knowledge laying out there just for anyone to pick up."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"No...Just
observant. Take Communism. Stripped of all the bullshit they add and
attach to the meaning of the word, what does it really mean? What's the
root of it?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee smiled, already
knowing where Damian was going. He'd heard all this before during his
short stint as a revolutionary, but he knew the kid thought he was
about to say something new and profound.</font><font color="#800000"> "Community."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"
That's right. But because people are told that Communism is defined by
Russia, Stalin, genocide, or some other fake situation, cooked up by
the forces of slavery and exploitation, they can't see that the only
way most people in the world can even survive without handouts and
charity is by a communal, group help, way of life; like it had been for
the Aboriginals since the dawning of man.<br><br>Communism/Community is
nothing less than the basic survival of the poor of the earth in
freedom. The species of man and woman is naturally communist. When they
are deprived of that way of life they can only survive as Slaves or
Wards. <br><br>If they can take a simple word like community and
propagandize it into something that people start frothing at the mouth
with hatred just to hear it spoken, it should be no wonder that they
can take a murderous demon and turn it into the god that half the world
is worshiping as some kind of benevolent father. "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">There was a long silence between the two men until Damian said. </font><font color="#800080">"
I can understand you joining the military to support your sister, but
why did you go the extra yard, why did you give your soul to it."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#800000">" I didn't give my soul to the U.S. military. I gave it to a belief."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Belief...what
belief? Imperialism, war, genocide, robbery, napalm, injustice,&nbsp;
clusterbombs...that's what you believe in, Lee?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"You're a remarkably <i>observant</i>, "</font><font color="#000000"> Lee grinned, </font><font color="#800000">"
young man, Damian, but there's still a lot you don't know. Before you
understand how this world really turns, you will never understand me so
don't form an opinion."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Too late.
I've had this one since I first saw those naked women and children
running in Vietnam, from those planes chasing them with napalm.
Everything I've learned since then, has only re-enforced it."<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"The
first problem, Damian, is that you looked at the United States Military
and you saw a Monolith--one giant machine just churning along in
perfect harmony. And the reason why you saw a Monolith is for the same
reason my sister read the Noah story and believed Noah was perfect in
righteous. It's because that's what you're told, showed and
indoctrinated to believe.<br><br>You believed it despite the fact that
you know that from that Nation came the greatest written document for
the freeing of man that has ever been written, at the same time where
men were kept as brutally treated, chattel slaves. That document didn't
say all "Humans" were created equal with certain inalienable rights, it
said "Men" and I'm sure you understand the difference.<br><br>You
believed it, despite knowing that the United States, was the only
Nation in history, where the master's sons, slaughtered themselves over
the condition of the slaves.<br><br>You believed it, despite seeing
with your own eyes how the people took to the streets, driven by basic
morality,and forced their Nation to surrender in a war they wanted to
win.<br><br>Believe me, Damian, if all I knew about the world was what
you know, I would've hated the United States too, and in fact, once
did. <br><br>But there's a struggle going on, Damian. It is ancient
and eternal, and what went on within the soul of the United States was
just a microcosm of it. It didn't stop with the U.S. Constitution, it
didn't stop with the Civil war and it didn't stop with the Vietnam
protests."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I've heard this same
song about "the great struggle" from that guy we left behind lying on
his back, but the Vietnamese, the Koreans, the Cambodians, people in
South America, Africa, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Somalia-- millions all over
the world are still just as dead, still just as tortured, still just as
unjustly impoverished and degraded. "<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"The
thing about body counts Damian, is that you can only count the corpses.
How many people weren't killed, attacked, degraded, tortured,
impoverished? You'll never know. You think after 9-11, when they
threatened the whole world with nuclear war, they never meant to start
one? But four years after they set their big agenda in motion it didn't
happen, and you know why...the struggle.<br><br>And that's what I
believe in. I'm a Special Forces warrior who defended life, liberty and
justice at the behest of the very same Nation who took life, liberty
and justice away from so many in the world. I'm a Special Forces
soldier, who hunted down other Special Forces soldiers, and not all of
them carried a foreign flag. That's just one of the things you never
knew. Somebody has to fight from the inside, Damian. Somebody has to
infiltrate the rungs of power, or the struggle for freedom would have
been over with Atlantis. The slavery faction, would have had complete,
unassailable power for all eternity. That's what the Noah curse was
about. It was a written agenda to the Initiates of the forces of
slavery. <br>
</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800080"><font size="4"><font color="#800080"><font color="#800000">It's
the forces of freedom in the universe, that's puts people like me on
the earth, because most people don't have the will, drive, or courage
to look evil in the face--to sit beside it, stand beside it, fight it
where it lives.<br>You had no idea of the kind of things they--using
forces like the Drakes did--but we did-- and though no one ever heard
about their actions or ours, they never got away scott free. Like Tony
said, it was game--a ruthless, deadly, game, but it was serious and it
was for the soul, freedom, of men, women, children and the universe. It
was the struggle and it was as old as the world."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You mean, like Jonestown?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee's eyes got wider<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"What do you know about Jonestown?"</font></font></font></font><br>
<font color="#800080"><font size="4"><font color="#800080"><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Everything."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee's voice sounded noticeably strained. </font><font color="#800000">"When
that happened, it was a pivotal point in my Military career. I was just
a young Sargent--had a bright future in the military if I wanted it--
but by that time my sister had died and all I wanted to do was finish
my remaining time and get out. Then some people pulled me in and told
me what really happened at Jonestown. The next morning I was in command
of an ultra secret, elite special forces unit assigned to the hunt."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000"><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You know, Lee. In the end, Zeus never saw the struggle. All he saw were the body counts."<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Neither
did you, Damian, but I did, and even if I had ended up in some unmarked
grave on the outer edges of Siberia, ultimately that would have been
all that mattered to me."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Why did
you let them live...Antonio and his soldiers? If the situation was
reversed they wouldn't have spared any of your people.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"
I recognized a couple of hard core criminals, but some of those people
with Tony are too young to have participated in anything more dastardly
than obeying their orders regarding the Iowees. They probably were
recruited right before the breach. Times have changed Damian-- in the
most drastic way imaginable. The great struggle is over--at least for a
long time to come. I just don't want to kill anymore."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian stood up and stretched.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What are your plans now?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Any suggestions?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"How did you survive the breach the first time?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">" I suspect the same way you did."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"The balm?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee nodded. </font><font color="#800000">"Along with other measures."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"If the Government had that formula all along, any idea why they didn't mass produce it?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"I
don't think they had it--at least not finished. I think they got the
perfected version from yours and McCloud's work and they had no more
time to mass produce it than you did. Besides, as you know, the balm
alone wasn't enough to save most lives. "<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Any ideas as to why the big Cheeses didn't use the balm on themselves or their children?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Short
answer;they just didn't want to do the hard part of surviving. You
know, the traveling, bearing the atmospheric conditions to acclimate
their systems, the less that 5 star food, the uncertainties, the
dangers of wild animals and people in a world where they no longer had
ultimate control and protection."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"That's the short answer?</font><font color="#800000"> </font><font color="#000000">Damian laughed.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000">"Yeah."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" What's the long answer?"<br><br></font><font color="#800000">" We don't have time. Besides, I think you know."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian agreed. </font><font color="#800080">"Lee,
according to the pattern the next breach that manifests here will be at
least ten times more devastating than the last one. You're committing
suicide by staying here, you know."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#800000">"I don't know that, Damian. There's always a chance of beating the odds. We have what...four years? What if <i>we</i> were to go underground?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"
You can do that. But you'll never be able to come back up. Being
underground weakens your system's ability to adjust to the surface, and
heaven only knows what kind of adjustments your body will have to make
after the next manifestation."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian looked out a window and saw the darkness getting blacker. " </font><font color="#800080">I want to get over to Chandie before she falls asleep.</font><font color="#000000"> "<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"You
think Command, and all the people who went underground with them will
be able to come back up, Damian, if they're still alive?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I
don't see how-- after all this time--at least not without being in a
very weakened state and fatally susceptible to the effects of the
changes that has taken place on the earth. They will probably be so
white as to be transparent--even the blackest ones who went under with
them. Their children may do a little better--especially if they were
genetically enhanced, like Antonio's group or gradually exposed some
way to the new earth. A third option is they, or their descendants can
kidnap some of the Descendants of the people who survived on the
surface and breed with them, or extract from their cells and genes. In
a few generations they may be able to resurface.<br><br>Maybe that's
the real reason why the Iowees were created; maybe they are some kind
of living storage of cells and genes. All the more reason to get away
from here unless you want to go where they are and check if the
Undergrounders, are still alive. I never underestimate NASA genius or
the ingenuity of the power Elite." </font><font color="#000000">Damian looked towards where Chandra awaited him.</font><font color="#800080"> I'll talk to you tomorrow before we part ways."</font><font color="#000000"> He turned.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000">"Damian..."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian paused.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Take the Iowees with you." <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></font></font></p>
