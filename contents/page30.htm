<div align="left"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">'Is there anything at all I can say or do, sir, to make you change your mind?"</font> 

</font><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Maguthaba smiled and shook his head. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"Son,
I'll be sixty-five years old next month. I never married...never
fathered any children. Lived my whole life trying to be Daddy to the
whole underprivileged world--trying to fix something god seemed to have
given up on a long time ago. My work, my pretensions was all I had--all
I've ever got up in the morning for. No, Damian. I've got nothing to go
through a whole lot trials and tribulation, trying to escape the wrath
of god for. I'm just going to go back home, get me that wife I've been
meaning to woo for 40 years now, sit out in any African breeze I can
find and rock beside her until the Ancestors come to get me."</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Maguthaba
leaned towards Damian, staring at him in a way that left Damian with
the exact feelings that the Englishman's open stare had given him.
Except Maguthaba's eyes weren't full of fear, but of acceptance and
contentment.</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"Let
me tell you this, son: The only reason I can fade out with such ease of
mind, body and spirit is you. It's somewhat selfish but I didn't tell
you to pick up my burden now did I?" </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He smiled.</font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman"> "I'm grateful to you Damian. You'll never know how much." </font>

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Maguthaba
reached into the smallest of the packed suitcases that were at his
feet. He pulled out a necklace of bones, teeth, shells and pearls. He
handed it to Damian.</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"I
know you are going to make it, son. It's going to be a hard, terrible
journey but I know you'll reach the end of it. By the time you get much
more than halfway through it I'll be an Ancestor. When you need help,
call on me. My spirit name is MugUdu "</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Maguthaba picked up his suitcases. He walked to the door, stopped and turned back.</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">"Call on me."</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">As
Maguthaba was walking out, all the others, who were casting their
future with Damian, were filing in. He could hear them saying their
goodbyes to Maguthaba, one by one, as the tall African, walked passed
them. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">When
they started entering into his presence, Damian's eyes eagerly sought
out the young Rootswoman. He was sure he'd spot her out even though he
knew there might be others besides her that were total strangers to
him. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
greeted Sheree, Steve, Mike, Mike's wife Feifong, who somewhat
disturbed him with the bold, flirtatious way she looked directly into
his eyes. </font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
greeted Janet. Next he welcomed a tall, demure, bespectacled,
strawberry blond-haired woman who introduced herself as Jane, the
daughter of Rhoady. Then he shook the hand of a very pretty teen-aged
girl. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">After
the girl, Ada walked in and smiled at him. He returned the affection.
That was everyone he expected but the Rootswoman. After waiting
anxiously for her to appear, he was disappointed that the Rootswoman
was late, or might not show up at all. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He looked over at Sheree who was grinning like the cat who swallowed the canary. </font>

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Where's the Rootswoman? Did she change her mind?"</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The pupils in her eyes were bouncing like Mexican jumping beans. She shook her head, </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"No." </font>

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><i>I don't see what's so funny. Everyone knew how important it is to stick to schedule and be on time</i>.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"When is she going to show up?"</font> 

</font></p>
<p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Janet giggled. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Sheree made a popping noise with her cheeks. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Already has."</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"What?" </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian looked around the room. <i>How could he have missed her?</i></font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><i> </i>"Where?"</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">It was happening again and it hurt no less than it ever did. Chandra put her hands on her hips.</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman">"What be di matta with yuh eyes, bwoy? I am di Rootswoman and I-wombman be no ghost."</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
gaped. She was pretty--very, very pretty; which was the first thing
that put her out of the range of what he expected to see in their
medicine woman. Next to that, she couldn't have been more than sixteen
years old---seventeen at the most. No way could she be a Rootswoman--an
apprentice in training maybe-- but they needed a full-fledged,
experienced Rootswoman for this journey. Sheree knew that. He looked
over at his godmother and threw daggers with his eyes. She was still
silently laughing. He was mad at her. He wasn't going to let her know
that in front of everybody or further embarrass the girl but she was <i>going</i> to know, that he is pissed. All the time wasted. And now they still have to find a real Rootswoman.</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Sheree, can I talk to you for a minute...in private?" </font>

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Sheree glanced at Janet, said something inaudible with her lips, and followed Damian out of the room. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Two minutes later Sheree and Damian re-entered the room. Janet saw Damian's face and doubled over with laughter. 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">For
two seconds Sheree frantically tried to hush her friend. Then she put
her hand over her own mouth just before she spat mirth all over the
room. She looked over at her niece and shook her head. </font>

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"I'm sorry, Chandie."</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
watched the young looking woman. The joke was a good one--if you knew
what was going on. Few people in Sheree's position could have passed up
such a glaring opportunity to so amuse the gods. Sheree wasn't the kind
of person who would maliciously hurt someone for a joke but the young
woman <i>was</i> hurt. He could see it in her eyes. Something else he
saw as he watched her standing there, looking so vulnerable, alienated,
different--not in the conventional sense--but in the spiritual way that
gentle people, who have been treated differently-- walked, looked over
all their lives get. That look-- that ethereal essence they exude, of
being half in the world and half out of it. He saw in that--in her, her
ageless beauty his reason to be, his pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow. Before, he was going to survive just for the sake of surviving
or for some abstract, grandiose idea of being the savior or regenerator
of the WoMan race. But now his goal was clearer, more focused, more
earthy. It was going to be for her. Everything, all of it... </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">For the love of Chandra. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Love? Did he just say to himself<i>, love? </i></font>

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Boss."</font> 

</font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian wanted to say something apologetic and healing to Chandra but Steve was rustling papers at him again. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"These are the calcs and projections you asked for."</font>
Damian took the papers and started reading. Steve, Mike, Ada, and Mr.
Maguthaba all worked on the report. At a glance he saw that most of it
confirmed what he had already concluded. The team projected:
</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">1. To
acclimate themselves to the earth changes, they will have to breathe
the air, eat the vegetation, absorb the altered atoms and molecules of
their new world; drink the water, feel the sun.
</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Conclusion:
They can start out in vehicles but they will have to complete most of
their journey on foot. The heat and altered atmosphere will soon render
the vehicles inoperable.</span>

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">2.
They will meet many people in the beginning. Most of those they meet
will be deathly ill. A few may be healthy enough to join or try to harm
them.
</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Conclusion: They will have to be prepared both to help who they can and defend themselves.</span> 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">3. Animals will be healthier than people and a far bigger threat.

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Conclusion: Surviving the starving or crazed animals will be their greatest challenge by the end of their journey.</span>

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">5. The last bolt before the pattern begins again is expected to hit on the Southern continent in about seven years. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Conclusion: They must time their journey so that they reach the Southern continent no earlier than seven years from date, at which point, the worst of the manifestions from Zeus's bolts in Africa, will have run its course</span>. 

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Analysis:
There are no sustainable constants to what Zeus is doing. Sometimes he
rests and the intervals range widely in time span from weeks to
centuries. Sometimes he regrets. Sometimes he rages. Sometimes he
forgives. Right now he is raging and in about 5 weeks, the Western
Hemisphere will suffer the greatest devestation to date. Most people
have no chance to survive the next month but the McCloud research group
can and possibly, even other <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span> prepared people around the world who are just plain lucky, or unlucky, depending on from what point of view you look at it.

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian smiled wryly at that last sentence. He could easily guess which of the four contributors to the thesis wrote it.

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">6. Babies or Children in their group will lower their odds of survival.

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Conclusion:
Though the ultimate goal is to replenish the WoMan race, procreation
must be avoided until they reach a period of respite. The first is in
seven years and is projected to last about 5 years. Then there will
come another fit of rage, projected to hit in the far East. After that,
the pattern shows an indeterminable period of calm. This will be their
chance to rebuild and replenish.</span>

</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">7. In
the beginning of their journey, most of the lakes, rivers, and streams
will be dried up. By the halfway point, most mountainous, and Arctic
regions, will be completely submerged in water. Later, the melted ice
caps will cause all the major bodies of water to rise-- flooding the
earth everywhere, replenishing all the water veins.
</font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Conclusion:
Start out carrying as much drinkable water as possible. Stick close to
the rivers and streams. Carry plenty of salt and purifying tablets.</span> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The list went on. While Damian was reading Ada passed out copies to everyone.

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian finished his reading and went into the biggest room in the wing, which was McCloud's cubicle.

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He switched on his recorder.

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">"Three more has joined us since I first listed our group. They are:

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">Chandra Fontaine, Herbal expert.

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">Jane Smith, School Teacher. 

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">Feifong Chu Steinson, Executive Secretary. Wife of Mike.

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">We are now nine.

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">Tomorrow
we begin our Journey to a new Genesis. To begin to acclimate our
systems to an altered atmosphere, we will start out in farthermost
southern part of the United States and travel Northward by foot until
we reach the New York Harbor. From there we will take a boat and cross
the Atlantic.
</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">The date is the second day of July, in the year 2009 A.D."

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He switched off the recorder.

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#6666ff">"You
do know that thing won't last anymore than any other kind of
electronics or gravity-assisted devices, don't you? Mike says that the
magnetic alteration in the atmosphere caused by the breach is going to
change physics and atomic reactions as we know it."
</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">"Now that you've mentioned it..."</font>
Damian looked up at Mike's sleight, beautiful wife and smiled. He was
more than a little surprised that she was so at ease and familiar with
him so soon. She was a tiny woman but the way she looked at him was the
way a predator looked at prey it was stalking--direct and unblinking.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">It
never occurred to him before but she was right. If his intent was to
leave a record for all posterity he was wasting his time with the
little gadget.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">"I don't know why I didn't think of it. I should be doing this the old-fashioned way."

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#6666ff">" I made a hundred grand a year doing that kind of thing."

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian laughed.<font color="#660033">
" I can't pay you quite that much. In fact, I'll only be able to pay
you in seashells--when we find a sea--but if you still want the job,
it's yours."</font> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She didn't even crack a smile.

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#6666ff">"Mike thinks a lot of you."</font>
She walked over to the desk he sat behind and picked up the old
fashioned paper weight which snowed when you shook it. She shook it.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
got stuck on her simple statement. The way she put it was muddy. And he
knew, deliberately so. Did she mean Mike thought a lot of him--meaning
Mike liked him--or did she mean Mike just thought and talked about him
a lot? From how she said it he couldn't discern which she meant but he
did discern one thing: this woman meant everything she said--every
word, every letter, every nuance, every reflection. She was one of
those word players-- the kind of people who thought they were smarter
than everybody else, with whom languages were a weapon they wielded to
bludgeon, defeat, belittle and to constantly remind themselves and
everyone else of their superiority.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">"I'm glad."</font> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She sat the paper weight down.<font color="#6666ff"> "I'll copy what you've already recorded."</font> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#660033">"Thank you."</font> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#6666ff">"How often will you need me?"</font> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
had to look into her eyes to assure himself that she didn't mean that
question the way her tone and body language presented it;they clarified
nothing.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He coughed. <font color="#660033">" I am a good friend of Mike. A good, <i>loyal</i> friend."</font>
That wasn't really true in general but it was, in certain specifics. He
and Mike had worked together as a team for a long time. Teams are like
family. You fight, you hate, you love, you resent, you compete but you
don't betray.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She leaned into him as she tugged the micro-recorder from his hand.

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font color="#6666ff">"So am I."</font> 

</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
sat bemused as he watched her turn and exit. But he soon thought of a
plausible explanation. The woman was a highly paid corporate animal.
You have to be a certain personality type to thrive or even last in
that kind of environment. She was direct, assertive, flirtatious, and
somewhat surreptitious, but he didn't know her well enough to subscribe
anything seriously negative to her or her personality. Besides, three
quarters of those descriptions was what he liked most about the kind of
women who usually appealed to him.
</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
really wanted to leave a lasting record behind him. If Mike didn't have
any problem with his wife scribing for him, neither would he. And even
if he couldn't trust her, he can always trust himself.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></p></div>
