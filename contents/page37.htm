Damian and Steve got back, the others in their group were anxiously
awaiting them. Chandra--whose face he sought out first-- looked so
relieved when she saw him, he felt like he had did her some grievous
wrong. When the group sat down to discus the soldiers, Ada moved so
close to Steve she was halfway in his lap. Steve looked smothered, his
expression registering annoyance with Ada, Damian had never seen on his
face before.<br><br>Damian told everyone what happened. <br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"What do you make of the two ETs? " </font><font color="#000000">Sheree asked.</font><font color="#ff00ff"> <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve looked at her. </font><font color="#408080">"Probably
some government experiment. That's how they do. They'll tell you about
something like stem cell research, and turn that into some kind of big
point of debate when all along they have been playing god and creating
life forms in the lab since before ancient Egypt."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Why would they do that?" </font><font color="#000000">Jane
asked. Her tone was confrontational. Damian saw a familiar fury darken
Steve's eyes. He and Steve had already discuss the Iowees. Steve
believed the little Beings were created to be slaves in this changed
world. Damian didn't agree because he thought the creatures were too
small and fragile to be slaves. But he wasn't dismissing Steve's theory
out of hand. No one was going to enslave anyone in his world. <br>
<br>
He answered Jane before Steve launched into one of his long-winded tantrums. </font><font color="#800080"><br><br>"We don't know for sure why, but it's obviously the little creatures were born in a lab to be used for some reason."</font><font color="#ff8040"><br>"That's awful." </font>Jane's
eyes were shining. When Damian looked from her to Steve, who was now
looking at Jane with different eyes, he saw something that made him
feel very sorry for Ada.<br>
<br>Feifong, who usually sat in the meetings like she had more pressing
things to do, was showing unusual interest in the discussion. Only one
other time, has Damian ever seen the look on her face so open and
unmasked. That was when she told him about her life in Vietnam.</font><font color="#8000ff"><br><br>What do we do about them? </font><font color="#000000">She
was asking Damian but Steve answered her, his long, prematurely white
hair and suddenly fierce, light blue eyes reminding Damian of the
photos he had seen of the martyred abolitionist, John Brown. The man
was a chameleon--consciously or unconsciously.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"If I'm right, we free them."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Everyone sensed it. For some reason the subject was extremely agitating to Mike. <br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"Look can we cut with the bullshit." </font><font color="#000000">He blurted. </font><font color="#0000a0">"I
hate this conspiracy crap. I agree that there have been experiments but
that's science okay? Nothing should be off limit to science and it
isn't. Whoopee! Big surprise! "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve stood up. </font><font color="#408080">"Excuse me everybody. I need to get some fresh air." </font><font color="#000000">Ada started to rise with him. </font><font color="#408080">"No
baby, this is important. We need your input. Stay here and discuss it
with the others. I'll be back in a little while...by the way,"</font> Steve turned his attention from Ada to them all,<font color="#408080"> "I don't want to influence anybody else's, but I vote no."</font><font color="#000000"> He left to take a stroll into the night.<br><br></font><font color="#8080ff">" I wish we could be sure we can trust them not to try to <span style="font-style: italic;">enslave us</span>. Then my vote will be easy."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"I agree with Janet." </font><font color="#000000">Sheree said.</font><font color="#ff00ff"> "That's the only thing that bothers me! I don't trust soldiers."<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"What did you say he looked like, again?" </font><font color="#000000">Feifong grinned at Damian.</font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Like an Asian Adonis."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian laughed.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Everyone but Mike laughed too.<br><br>Damian was glad to see Feifong disregarding Mike's feeling for a change.<br><br>They
could all sense Mike blatantly emitting to Jane, even as they sat
there. He knew Feifong could too and it angered him, though he knew she
would never want anyone to confront Mike about the way he treated her.<br><br>Jane,
who had been watching Ada, since the meeting began, and her quiet
desperation in her actions toward Steve, leaned over and whispered
something to&nbsp; Chandra, who was sitting between she and Damian. Out
of the side of his eye, Damian saw Chandra nod. He coughed
uncomfortably before speaking to the group, again.</font><font color="#0000ff"></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"T</font><font color="#800080">his
is just my opinion, but I don't think the Newcomers are any kind of
threat to us. Highly trained soldiers like those don't harm anything
that they hadn't been sicced on. Those guys would call a six year old,
sir, by impulse and kowtow a derelict like he was god's own vizier if
told to. They could have still killed me and Steve if they wanted
too--guns or not-- but once they saw we were no threat to them, they
weren't going to so much as throw a punch if we had cursed out their
mothers. I think it will be a good thing to have them around. I vote,
yes." </font><font color="#000000">He looked at each of them in turn.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Anybody else have anything to say?" </font><font color="#000000">Silence met his query.</font><font color="#800080"> "Then let's call it...<br><br>Chandie?"<br><br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage45.jpg" height="207" width="257"> <br><br></font><font size="2"></font><font color="#000000">Chandra after 3 years<br></font><font size="3"></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yes."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">Sheree...?<br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage46.jpg" height="355" width="286"> </font><font size="2"></font><font color="#000000">Sheree three years later<br></font><font size="3"></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Yes"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Mike...?"<br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage47.jpg" height="248" width="231"> </font><font size="2"></font><font color="#000000">Mike three years later<br></font><font size="3"></font><font color="#400080">"No."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Ada...?"<br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage48.jpg" height="322" width="203"> </font><font size="2"></font><font color="#000000">Ada three years later<br></font><font size="3">"</font><font color="#0000a0">Yes."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000a0"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Janet...?"<br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage49.jpg" height="282" width="176"> </font><font size="2"></font><font color="#000000">Janet three years later<br></font><font size="3"></font><font color="#8080ff">"Yes."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"How about you, Jane...?"<br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage50.jpg" height="266" width="295"> </font><font size="2">Jane 3 years later<br></font><font size="3"></font><font color="#ff8000">"Yes."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Fei...?"<br><br><img title="" alt="" src=".%5Cimage51.jpg" height="179" width="144"> </font><font color="#8000ff">"Yes."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"That's seven yays, and two nays. The yays have it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">At that moment Steve returned. His thoughts of attacking Mike were no longer transmitting. What he <i>was </i>emitting
was nothing they haven't all sensed before, but never so strongly,
never so devoid of internal struggle and self-condemnation.<br><br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I've got to figure out some things." </font><font color="#000000">He said softly to Ada.</font><font color="#408080"> "I'll be back in a few hours." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">From
the start, Damian had a feeling that Steve's opposition to joining the
other survivors wasn't as much due to distrust of the soldiers, as it
was to fear--fear of losing something.<br><br>A night had fallen that
was so moonless, none of them could see their hands in front of their
face, but Damian could still see in his mind's eye, the tears, as Ada
watched Jane start off after Steve. They all could.<br><br><br>******************<br><br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Why did you follow me?" </font><font color="#000000">Steve was sitting on the ground with his back to Jane. He didn't turn around when he heard her approach.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>She said nothing until she had settled down on the ground beside him.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Because you wanted me to."</font><font color="#000000"> Her voice was low, whispery.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I've wanted a lot of things for a long time. But they never came to me before."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"That's because you were never so sure before, and neither was I."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#408080">What makes you so sure all of a sudden?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"What makes <i>you</i>?"</font><font color="#000000"> She retorted.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">" I don't know. I guess I'm just afraid that time is running out on me."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"The other survivors?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He nodded, a gesture she never saw, but didn't need to.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"What about Ada?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He sighed heavily. </font><font color="#408080">"I've
known Ada for over 12 years. Sure, I've always wanted her but I never
wanted her enough to even risk asking her out before our friends
started dying around us. Before then, she had always seen me as some
kind of big, adorable clown. Lovable but not fuckable. I've become
fuckable to her now." </font><font color="#000000">He turned to face Jane.</font><font color="#408080"> "But when a man finds his true heart's desire;less than everything is not enough."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Please
don't lie to me Steve. It's not necessary. And don't lie to yourself.
You don't have to desecrate what you have with Ada to be with me"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I--"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"You loved her. You still do."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I'm in love with you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She didn't respond.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Why did you come Janie? You are not a betrayer. And you're not the type to casually hurt someone."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"I'm lonely."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"But
we'll be joining the Newcomers soon. You have waited nearly three years
for companionship. The end of loneliness awaits you with the dawn, so
why now...why tonight?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Because I
love you and tonight is the first time you've told me that you can
accept that and all the consequences that may come from it."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I can't be with you both."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"I know."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"How do I tell Ada?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"You don't."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">" I don't?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"She'll know."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Of course she'll know. That's not what I mean."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"What <i>do</i> you mean?"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Us...how do I explain to Ada, us...<i>this</i>? Our love?<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Steve, there is no <i>our</i>
love. There's my love and your festering desires. You think I have
forgotten the difference between how you thought of me for the first
few years and how you feel now? Just tonight Steve...now."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"People <i>fall</i> in love Janie."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Yes, but sometimes the hardest part is knowing what they fell in love with. I fell in love with <i>you</i>--your
sense of humor, your intelligence, your method in how you chose your
friends and your loyalty to them, your integrity, your
gentleness...what did you fall in love with Steve?<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Dammit Janie, why are you doing this?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"For Ada."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Let me see if I've got this right." </font><font color="#000000">Steve ran his hands through his long hair.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"You will be with me for one night. Knowing how much it's going to hurt Ada. And it's supposed to be for Ada's sake"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"I
will hurt her for one night--maybe a year, maybe longer but you will
hurt her forever unless you set her free, or at least give her a clear
reason to decide whether or not she wants to continue to give her heart
to a man whose own heart pines for another. I know what that feels
like."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Fuck you. Who do you think you are? You spend too much fucking time with--"</font><font color="#000000"> He stopped himself.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"What do you want, Steve?"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">" I want you to get the hell away from me."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She stood up. <br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Janie!"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She was heading back towards the camp. She stopped walking.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"What do you want, Steve?"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">" I want to set Ada free."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She turned and started walking away again.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"My god Janie...what do you want me to say?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"I want you to tell yourself and me the truth. What do you really want?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">His voice choked </font><font color="#408080">"I want to make love to you."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000">She walked over and stood directly in front of him.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"For one night?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve nodded.<br><br>She sat down beside him and closed her eyes as he buried his face in her chest.<br><br><br>The
next morning Damian and all the others sensed that Ada had distanced
herself from Steve but no one sensed her crying. When her thoughts
turned to Jane there was no anger, hatred or emissions of malice. There
was only an unreadable silence, lightly tinged with a breath of relief.
