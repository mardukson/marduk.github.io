was no conscious choice made by either group to join together--no votes
or consensus taken. Time and circumstances had thrown them together and
it was inertia that kept them together so far.<br><br>It took three
months for Steve--who was the most injured one of Damian's group--to
recuperate enough to travel. During that time Lee and his people just
hung around.</font></font><p><font size="5"><font size="4">They were
still living off government issued rations. But their food supply was
low and most likely injurious to their health. Lee observed how Damian
and his people were living and he knew that if he wanted to survive in
the long run, he had learn from the Civilians. So he ordered his people
to maintain a low profile, make themselves as useful as they could, and
try to ingratiate themselves to the Civs.<br><br>Damian's group had
lost all taste for merger, strangers, new and excitement. They became a
hub, tribal, and distant from both Lee's group and Antonio's people.<br><br>When
the ice began to break between Lee's and Damian's Charges, it wasn't
lust or need or dependency that opened the two groups up to one
another. It was time, circumstance and plain old fashioned decency.<br><br>Lee's
group were irresistibly courteous and respectful. Friendships began to
develop. First between the two leaders--Damian and Lee. Then other
friendships began to form. When the two groups learned each other's
names, it wasn't though any kind of formal introduction but through an
eventual one on one, personal basis.<br><br>Feifong learned that the
Asian soldier in Lee's unit was named Bruce(Lee)Akimoto. From her,
Damian learned the man's name and from Damian Chandra learned it and so
forth and so on.<br><br>Jane discovered, when the light-haired soldier
from Lee's group was helping her carry water to the camp one day, that
his name was Patrick(midnite) Henry. He wasn't as tall as she nor was
he very good looking but she saw in him some of the same qualities that
caused her to fall in love with Steve. He had more qualities of a good
priest, than a soldier and she instantly responded to that gentleness,
and decency about him.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font size="4">The Latino in Lee's unit, was named
Felix(cat) Santiero. Janet, and everyone else, who didn't know, found
that out the day Lee and two others had to physically restrain Felix
when he found out what happened to Janet's face. She heard him
screaming about killing Antonio, who was still flat on his back, neck
all but broken by the&nbsp; hulking man in Lee's unit, named Alonzo(big
house)Breiner. <br><br>For the second time, Janet ditched Sheree for a
man. She still loved Sheree dearly, but she simply wanted a
man--especially that particular man, who would struggle so hard, to
kill over her. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font size="4">Her face was healing but it was clear
she will never be the flawless beauty that she was before. That still
left her in the category of gorgeous and Felix had no trouble seeing
that. He waited for her...waited on her. Between Janet and Felix, their
relationship was a meeting of hearts rather than just the loins, as it
was for Janet with Antonio. <br><br>In the meantime fate had been
kinder to Sheree than it was the last time Janet left her. Dark,
beautiful eyes followed her every move, watching...waiting;eyes that
instantly recognized in the beautiful older woman a kindred soul. Her
name was Isabella Rossolini. She was one of the females in Lee's
Special Forces, unit. Her companions called her "Hi-note." Eventually,
Sheree and everyone else who didn't already know, found out why.<br><br>If
Feifong had finally given up on Mike and turned to Bruce, it was
because it was clear that Mike had found something--someone special.
Her name was Shakira(shakes)Phieres. She had long dark, curly hair and
big brown laughing eyes.<br><br>A lot of good feelings were being
emitted towards Mike these days--especially from Steve. He was clearly
a man who was more content and at peace with himself. Whether that had
more to do with Shakira, or the new acceptance he was feeling from his
group was anyone's guess. Mike was emitting sincerity and pure emotions
rather than pure lust in his disregard for his wife Feifong, in his
feelings for Shakira, and nobody found it easy to begrudge him for it.<br><br>There
was a male in Lee's unit named Chako(one trick pony) Morningsky. Like
David Bravefeather, he had classic Native American facial features.
Damian never thought about it before, but seeing Ada gravitate towards
two Native Americans, he realized that she probably was at least half
Native American herself. He couldn't help feeling bad for Steve because
everyone could sense that in Chako, Ada had found what she was looking
for. <br><br>The others in Lee's unit were:<br><br>Alonzo(big
house)Breiner; a huge, physical specimen. He was not near as tall as
the seven footer, Steve, but he was far more muscular. He was of some
kind of mixed heritage, white-skinned, with Negro facial features. He
and another female soldier in Lee's unit, named Kiesha Ranes, was a
couple. All Lee's people had nicknames and Kiesha--a mix-raced
person(Black/Asian)-- was called "Gieshagirl" by her companions. She
was slim, quiet and pretty.&nbsp; And devoted to Alonzo like a pampered
pet.<br><br>The other female in Lee's unit, was named
Tiararay(nails)Mumphrey. She was Lee's woman. Tall and dark like Lee,
she wore her hair in thin braids. Her fingernails were so long they
curled into her palms. Something wasn't right about that picture but
Damian figured she grew them after the year long lull in any encounters
with danger.<br><br>Nothing was officially announced but Damian's and
Lee's group had merged. Thanks to Chandra's expert care, Steve was well
enough to travel. It was time to move on.<br><br>Antonio and Mustafa, were still on their backs, unable to travel. No one else in Antonio's unit had been seriously hurt.<br><br><br>As
Damian and Lee set out to leave, the men and women they were leaving
behind, sat, stood, and lay in various positions, some with almost
teary faces--mostly when they looked at the Iowees--, but others were
staring with faces full of hatred.<br><br><br><br><br><font color="#ff0000">"It's not over, Lee, if you leave it like this. </font><font color="#000000">Antonio called out.</font><font color="#ff0000"> You know the rules. You should kill me."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee paused. </font><font color="#808000">"Be glad to Tony, except it's not just you."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#808000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"It's, kill or be killed, Lee and it always have been between our kind."<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Since when?&nbsp; We don't kill surrendered people, Tony. We're warriors not bloodhounds."<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"You're
chickenshit, Lee. You know it's different for our kind than it is with
regular Soldiers. You should kill me and you know it. Chickenshit.
That's why in the end you always lose."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Antonio slowly turned his severely strained neck to train his hatred on Damian. </font><font color="#ff0000">"No matter where you go-- anywhere in this whole wide world-- I swear we'll find you...all of you. Vengeance <i>will </i>be mine."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Why? Because you lost a fight?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">''
No, because you broke my brother. You took his spirit, and you repaid
my family's generosity in sparing you your life by betraying us. You'll
pay dearly for that, boy."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"We betrayed you by not letting you take what belonged to us--lord it over us?"<br><br><br></font><font color="#000000">If Antonio heard Damian, he gave no indication, or credence to his words.<br><br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Lee
and me, we are alike. We're SFS. The best of the best. We know the game
and all the rules. We live and die by the rules. And there is no
hatred, no sorrow in it when we lose to one another; there is only
respect and honor in the way you fight. But you fucking Civs...you
don't fuck with us, you don't defeat us, and you don't take from us. We
do the taking. We do the killing. We do the fucking."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian put his face so close to the prone man, their noses were almost touching.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You
lay there on your back--helpless as a new born baby-- and threaten me
and everything in the world that I care about. That's makes you either,
very brave, or very stupid. For either case you deserve a second chance
but if you say one more thing, I swear,<i> I</i> will finish breaking your goddamn neck ."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Antonio's
eyes said plenty--declared more war and called down every unholy curse
that had ever been uttered-- but his tongue said nothing more. After a
long minute of intense eye-to-eye contact, he finally, slowly and
painfully, turned his head to the side.<br><br>The rest of the two opposing groups stared hard at each other as Lee's and Damian's people began to moved on.<br><br>Mustafa--like
Antonia--was still on his back, his eyes still shut, his ribs still
poking through the skin and half his front teeth still lying over there
somewhere near where he and Damian had fought. He didn't look as much
like Muhammad Ali, now, as he did like bad, bad Leroy Brown of the
famous Jim Croce, song.<br><br>Damian might have been looking like
something similar to Mustafa because their fight was no unanimous
decision; it was a split decision, which down to the very last second,
could have gone either way. The difference in the way the two men were
recovering was in who had nursed them. Mustafa was being taken care of
by his group's medics. Damian was healed by the love his life. The
herbs she mixed up and rubbed on his wounds to keep down the swelling
and staunch the flow of blood; the wraps she put on his broken bones;
the words she whispered into his disorientated mind; the caresses she
gave his burning needs.... he had something to get better for and he
did. So quick and thoroughly, the difference between the way he looked,
from the way Mustafa looked six weeks after their fight, was the
difference between the way Pernell(sweat pea) Whittaker looked after a
fight and the way Rocky Balboa looked after a fight.<br><br>Mustafa had moisture in his eyes as he watched Chandra walking away from him.<br><br>Rick
wasn't crying but his eyes were boring holes in Jane's back. Damian saw
it before, and watching Rick, he was seeing it now. The guy wasn't
going to give up until somebody was dead.<br><br>Michelle--all six feet
of her--was staring at Steve. Damian was told about the confrontation
between her and Antonio. He saw in the way she was looking at Steve a
possible opportunity to help his friend. Steve clearly had no interest
in romance now that Ada was lost but time heals all wounds and the tall
woman obviously had feelings for the big, tall man. Besides that,
everyone could see that she had hurt herself with her group. She was
being ostracized already. Who knew what Antonio would do to her once he
got back on his feet? <br><br>Damian asked Chandra to see if she could talk the strikingly beautiful soldier, into coming with them. <br>
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Chandra
approached Michelle and said something to her. Damian couldn't hear
what she said to the tall woman, but he did see the big smile that lit
up Michelle's face. Antonio's renegade warrior walked over with Chandra
to join him and Lee.<br>
Damian saw in Michelle's face and body, that every insult hurled at her
back, hit her like a hollow tip bullet. But she kept walking away from
her old Unit with her head held high. Jane--the only evidence of the
brutal beating she took, left, being a a fading black-eye--walked over
to Michelle and took the hand that Chandie wasn't holding.&nbsp; <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></font></p>
