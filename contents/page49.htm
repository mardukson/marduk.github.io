<div align="left"><i><font size="4">I'm coming Lee. Won't be long now, soul brother. <br><br></font></i><font size="4">Antonio lay awake on his back, staring at the stars long after all the others in his unit were asleep. <br><br>Damian
would have found it hard to recognize him; his coal black hair now fell
down past his shoulders, the&nbsp; space age military uniform had been
ripped up and made into a scanty loin cloth. His heavily muscled chest
and arms were bare. Always extraordinarily handsome, he was now truly a
magnificent creature to behold. Like a Olympian god.<br><br>The others in his group had also shed their uniforms for a loin cloth, and they all looked bigger and stronger.<br><br>Mesha
and Tameka had learned a little from Chandie, about how to gather up
vegetation to eat. They knew nothing about how to fix an eggplant so
that it tasted like chicken, or how to make cress salad explode on your
tongue like something that a master chef would set before a King, but
they knew enough about what to find to keep their group alive. They
also prepared meat when they could.<br><br>Since Antonio and Mustafa
fully recovered, the Drakes had been tracking Lee and his unit with a
single-minded obsession--Antonio's obsession.<br><br><i>Should have killed me Lee, when you won the fight. You knew the rules.<br><br></i>Now
they have found them. Lee and his unit had planted roots in the wilds
of Canada. They were digging in--literally. Everyday, they were out
there working on a hole that was now, as big in length and width as a
small town. And they were doing it all with shovels, picks and
wheelbarrows.<br><br>Antonio had been observing them for three days,
all that time, he was hoping to catch a glimpse of the Iowees. They
weren't with Lee. He didn't know what Lee did with them, but he was
going to find out. He was going to find out a lot of things...then he
was going to settle things with Lee once and for all.<br><br>Of course it will be done with honor. They had some nicely built huts close to the big hole they were digging. </font><font size="4">He saw no weapons on them, but he was certain they had some somewhere. </font><font size="4">He
was sure Lee had prepared the Dragonhunters as well as he had prepared
his Drakes. He had put his people through exhaustive combat drills with
the knives and spears that they now carried. He had to assume Lee has
done the same. Lee knew he was coming. <br><br>The last time; he had
fought Lee without David, Mustafa and...Michelle, that traitorous
bitch! He wished now he had killed her when she blatantly disobeyed his
direct order. But she<span style="font-style: italic;"> was</span>
their best Medic. Besides that, he wanted her sexually. That's
something else he should have done. Taken what he wanted, when he
wanted it, instead of spending four years trying to win her over. He
won't make that mistake again.<br><br>He saw that Lee was the one who
was shorthanded this time. He only had two of his male warriors with
him. All his female troops were still with him, plus two of the
Civs--Janet and that fatheaded prick who couldn't fight his way out of
a paper bag if it was smothering him to death. That left Him, David,
Mustafa, Rick, John, Mesha, Sonya, and Tameka, against Lee, Felix,
Tiararay, Alonzo, Shakira and...the mouse. He couldn't think of her
name because she never said anything so</font><font size="4"> nobody ever spoke it.<br>
<br>
This was going to be almost too easy.</font><br>
<font size="4"><br>Maybe he should offer Lee a choice to fight without
weapons. He was going to kill them all, except the Civs--maybe even
torture the big, white Nigger, who almost broke his neck. But there was
no hate or spite between warriors, only honor and dishonor, in the way
you fight and die. Yes, he'll give Lee better odds to die honorably
since Lee had always lived, honorably. The outcome of the coming fight
was not in doubt--with, or without weapons--so why not use the
opportunity to tune up for the real fight--the one with that boy.<br>
<br>Lee was going to die, but he will give him a proper burial--give them <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> a proper burial. And why not? They've already dug the hole.<br><br>But
those goddamn Civs! He could hardly sleep at night for thinking about
them. They probably have the Iowees too, though he can't see Lee and
his people, willingly giving up the Iowees. He <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> know that Lee wouldn't have killed them, so where else could they be but with that boy?<br><br>He
knew where Damian was going. He'll find him...just like he found Lee.
When he does;what he's going to do to Lee is just soldier business, but
with those Civs;it's <i>all</i> about hate and vengeance. <br>
<br>
He could see Damian in his mind's eye now. First he will let Mustafa
and Rick have him--work him over--then, make him watch Mustafa do that
bitch they were fighting over until she pukes. <br>
But Damian, and those Boots who deserted Lee and their unit, are the
only one who are going to die. He hated fucking scalawags, so they are
going to die like the traitors they are. <br>
<br>
Michelle and the Civs are just going to wish they were dead after a while. Maybe not Michelle--if she acts right.<br>
<br>
Fucking Civs.<br>
<br>
Think they can fuck he and his family! They'll learn--when they and
their children are cleaning his house, scrubbing his toilets, cooking
his food, working his garden-- that soldiers and their Superiors do the
fucking. And in this world it's going to be just like it was in the old
world. Slaves and Kings.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></div>
