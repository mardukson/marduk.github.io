big cat was in full stretch when she entered the woods. When she came
within a few yards of the object of the scent she had been following,
she stretched her fore-legs one time too many and fell into a six foot
deep pit. She landed on her feet, but try as she might, she couldn't
climb out of the hole.<br><br>Mustafa, David, Rick, Tameka, Sonya, and
John had worked like maniacs digging that hole. Rick could almost smell
Jane and Steve now, and his fractured brain was functioning normally in
its single-minded intent. He wanted Jane, and he wanted to kill Steve.
They had finished camouflaging the hole just ten minutes before they
heard the cat streaking in their direction.<br><br>David threw a spear
down in the hole at the cat. He missed. He picked up another just as
the sound of leaves rustling, echoed in the distance. John grabbed
Bravefeather's arm. <font color="#0000ff">"We'll kill it later. Let's go." <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></div>
