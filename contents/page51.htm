<div align="left"><font size="4"><font color="#ff0000">"Today, goddammit!" <font color="#000000">Antonio growled like a coach before the big game.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Yeeeah!"</font><font color="#000000"> Mustafa thumped his chest with his fist.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Antonio and his unit were gathered around, going over their battle plan.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Moose,
I want you and John, to take out the white nig--uh boy together. He's
the strongest one in their unit. We take him down, and half the battle
is over."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Yes <i>sir!</i>" </font><font color="#000000">Mustafa's eyes gleamed. His missing front teeth made the words come out as, "stess stir."</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Rick, you kill the Spic. After you do him, get Fathead, but don't kill him if you don't have to."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Sonya scowled. </font><font color="#ff8080">"What's with all the slurs lately Tony? You're a Spic your goddamn self." </font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#000000">Since
his Mother--whose family raised him-- was Anglo, and his Father only
quarter Mexican, he had never in his life saw himself as a Latino, or
anything else but a white man. His last name was pronounced "George,
not Jorge', and not many people in his life had made the mistake of
mispronouncing it twice. Still, Sonya was right. The military taught
its Commanders to put a lid on their racism for a reason and he was
smart enough to know what that was. He couldn't afford to drive any
wedges between himself and his people. He wasn't racist anyway. At
least not with his family. He would die for any of them.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"You're
right, Sonya. I guess it's that goddamn boy...stuck his black nose
right in my face and turkeyed me. But yawl know it was only because of
my neck. Still, I can't get it out of my mind how he punked me. I see
his&nbsp; face in my sleep every night and I guess it's starting to
effect me. It won't happen again I promise you...You too Moose."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">" What?"</font><font color="#000000"> Mustafa said.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Antonio went back to detailing the plan.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"I'll take out Lee. Sonya, you take Lee's woman. Don't let her scratch you with those monkey paws. You see her nails?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Sonya exhaled and pursed her lips </font><font color="#ff8080"><i>"fuck,"</i></font><font color="#000000"> she said under her breath. She was reeeeally beginning to dislike this bastard.<br><br>She
had joined the unit three years before the big breach. Been on about a
dozen missions. Done a lot of killing but she couldn't recall much
about who, why or how she killed. During that entire period she was
strung out on drugs. She could get release from the torment over her
dead child no other way. Now, all her drugs were gone. She never went
through any kinds of withdrawal pangs and didn't know why. But she was
getting her memories and her conscience back. She'd rather have the
drugs.<br><br>She was ex-military when she joined the Special Forces.
Dishonorably discharged for beating a black woman to death during a
traffic accident and dispute, despite the fact that her 2 year old
daughter was killed in that accident and the woman had attacked her
first. She just lost it, blanked out and went into killing mode. It
wasn't racially motivated, but she knew those who recruited her for the
Drakes unit thought it was. Thought she was some lowlife scumbag who
would eagerly go around killing people for no reason but hate for what
they were born looking like.<br><br>Her best friend in the Unit was
Michelle. She missed her so much. She wished desperately, that&nbsp;
she had deserted with her. She was sick of her life. Sick about her
past, sick of the memories, sick of being straight. She needed
something or she was going to slit her wrists soon. Marijuana, did
nothing for her and that's the only kind of drug she can get now in
this godforsaken world. <br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Mesha,"</font><font color="#000000"> Antonio was saying, forgetting his promise 2 minutes after he made it, </font><font color="#ff0000">"You get the Sandnigger."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Shakira?</font><font style="color: rgb(255, 153, 255);" color="#000000">" <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Being Ukrainian for twenty, of her 30 years, Mesha had no idea what a Sandnigger was.</span></font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Yeah, Shakira...Tam, you take the mouse. "<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Yes sir," <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tameka
smiled, her perfect white teeth, overkill, shining in such a dazzling
beautiful face. She had to be the most gorgeous straight woman in the
world, who at the age of twenty-seven, has never had a man show
interest in her. Her romantic situation was one of the unexplained
mysteries of the world, or proof positive that personality was like
magnetic force--it&nbsp; can attract and it can repel. </span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
