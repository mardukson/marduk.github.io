Antonio was sitting in a chair, basking in the sun, watching Mike and
Janet load supplies on the boat they had chosen to use to cross the sea.<font color="#ff0000"> "Come here."<font color="#000000">
Sonya was sitting on his lap. He had his hand between her legs. Mike
limped over to him. Sonya opened her mouth and Antonia fed her a red
pill. Mike stood in front of them trembling with rage, but in the past
few months he had been taught the dire consequences of losing control
of his emotions. <br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Aint you some kind of Scientist or something? "<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" I'm an Ecologist."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" What's that?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike
stared, more than willing to die for the satisfaction of cursing the
bastard to hell, but he didn't want to leave Janet alone. Sometimes at
night--when it was real quiet, he thought he could hear Damian and the
others in his mind. Sometimes he concentrated really hard in hopes that
maybe they could hear him. He hoped that once Antonio set sail, and
they started getting closer to Damian, he will be able to contact
Damian with his thoughts. It was the one thing, besides Janet that kept
him alive.<br><br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Never mind.
Whatever it is, I'm putting you in charge of the logistics of getting
us across that ocean, which means if we run into any problems that
don't have to do with the wind and the rain, I'm blaming you."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"You don't have enough food."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"What...we've
got three months of food supplies ready to be loaded. It shouldn't take
more than two months tops, at sea, to reach the Islands and resupply."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"You
have three months of food for living on land but the sea water mist
will spoil the food supply at least twice as fast as land air.<br></font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Antonio cupped Sonya's left breast and rolled the nipple between his fingers. He smiled.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"See?
That's why I'm putting you in charge of things, but you weren't going
to keep that knowledge to yourself and let us get out there and starve,
were you, gimp?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" I would have told you."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" What were you waiting on?
