<p></p><font size="4"></font></div><font size="4">They all got back on
the boat. Chandra, Jane and Michelle, immediately went to work at
preparing a meal. If they weren't feeling the hunger pangs before, the
wafts of Michelle's expertise with spices and herbs soon had them all
remembering what three days without food was supposed to feel like.<br><br>When
they sat down to eat, the first thing Steve did was throw the big cat a
taste of the vegetarian meal. She sniffed at it before lapping it up.
Then she looked up at Steve for more. <br><br></font><font color="#004000">" I'll be damned!" </font><font color="#000000">Chako exclaimed.</font><font color="#004000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080">"I'll be damned too,"</font><font color="#000000"> Steve said to the cat,</font><font color="#008080">" before I give you any more of my supper. "</font><font color="#000000"> He stuffed a big spoonful in his mouth and shrugged. </font><font color="#008080">"Who knew?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You got any extra?" </font><font color="#000000">Damian asked Chandra</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"There's plenty of fixings left, yes--if no one wants seconds."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Michelle
stood up and went into the boat's kitchen. She came back with a big
bowl full of greens. She set it down before the big cat who took one
whiff before she went to work lapping in earnest.<br><br>Damian thought as he watched the tiger, the world had truly become a bizarre place in which to try to live.<br><br><br>***************<br><br>The
next Island they landed on was much more to what Damian expected. There
was even sounds of the living that weren't their own. He was sure if
they moved much farther inland they would find it as modern as the
Island of Trinidad, but they had no intentions of moving very far
inland, or any need to. The coast was a vegetarian's dream, and the
scent of the air was sweeter than berries compared to the smell of the
place they had just left. They could stay here a while. Get their land
legs back and have plenty of supplies to take with them when they leave.<br><br>They began to unload the ship and set up for at least a 2 month stay.<br><br>The
big cat didn't run wild this time. She found a spot and lay down near
the frolicking Iowees, drowsily watching them with constantly opening
and closing eyelids.<br><br>When night fell, the moon seemed close
enough to touch, it didn't get much colder than it was during the
daylight hours and the mood with the scenery and pleasant scents was
surreal in the way it affected them all. They were all paired off; the
sounds of people making love seemed as natural as the chirps, whistles
and calls of nature . <br><br>Damian didn't unclothe Chandra but she
was in his arms, the two of them enjoying the stillness of their deep
love as much as they did when they were being physical.<br><br>Finally Chandra said softly:<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"I wonda wat mi Auntie is feelin' ri' now?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
wondered if she read his thoughts, or he hers, because he was wondering
the same thing. No one should be alone on a night like this--especially
when they can clearly hear other people being together.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Why don't we go find out? Be company for her?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra was up almost before he finished his suggestion. She grabbed his hand. </font><font color="#0000ff">"Okey."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">They
walked over to where Sheree had set up. Since they had the boat to
carry as much gear as they wanted, they had raided the sports supply
stores of New York, and with a lot of other things, taken some outdoor
tents to use as shelter. Damian knocked on Sheree's tent. <br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Sheree..."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Auntie..."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Damian, Chandie...come in."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She
had been reading. Damian looked at her face and he saw no signs of
unhappiness there. Not even in the emotions she emitted did he sense
any sorrowful feelings--in fact, from what she was transmitting, she
was feeling pretty damned good.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What art thou reading?"</font><font color="#000000"> Damian boomed in his imitation of Othello. Chandra giggled.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Chandie...come and sit here." </font><font color="#000000">Sheree hugged her when she obeyed. </font><font color="#ff00ff">"You too, Damian, sit close to me. It's so good of you two to think about me on a night like this." </font><font color="#000000">She held up the book and looked at it's cover. </font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">It's called Nimrod:Lost son of Sumeria."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Really...Is it about <i>the</i> Nimrod?"</font><font color="#000000"> Damian asked.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">" Yes, and it's very good."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" What made you pick up a book about Nimrod?" </font><font color="#000000"><br>
<br>
She had taken it off the shelf of a bookstore before they left New York .</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"
I don't know. I've been thinking about that story in the bible, off and
on since you started talking about Zeus and a new Genesis. When I saw
the title on the cover in the store I just picked it up."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"
Is he a good guy or bad guy in the book, because I've never heard a
story where Nimrod was depicted as a good guy. Even Satan and Hitler
had people who thought they were good guys, but as far as I know,
Nimrod never had a single fan. None who would openly admit it anyway."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">" He's a good guy in this book. In a lot of ways; the way the Author depicts him, reminds me of you."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Are you serious?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Yes."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"Can I read it when you're finished?" Both Damian and Chandra asked at the same time.<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Yes.
You two can read it together. I see you in the book too, Chandie, but
you will be a composite of three Characters because one of them dies
and one is cold and vengeful, but they all have some of your
characteristics, and two of them love Nimrod, like you love Damian."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" I cyan nuh wait ti read it, Auntie."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">I'll give it to you as soon as I finish."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Sheree, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Ask, but I already know what you want to know Damian, and I don't mind talking about it." <br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Do you miss Isabella--I mean do you regret leaving her?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">" I miss Janet more. And no, I don't regret being where I am Damian."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Don't you get lonely?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Yes...but
I'm used to long periods of being alone. Don't worry so much about my
happiness, Damian. I'm as happy as I've ever been, which is not saying
too much for that state of being, but I'm OK. I'll be OK."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra
leaned over and wrapped her arms around her Aunt. Sheree closed her
eyes and basked in her niece's embrace, her face a mask of pure
pleasure.<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Oh Chandie, I wish I had
spent more time with you when you were younger. Forgive for saying
this; but my brother is such a grouch, I couldn't stand to be around
him for five minutes. I hated the way he talked to people--especially
Verlene, even though I knew he was always all bark and no bite."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"
I know Auntie. Him mellowed sum in he old age, but him neva learned how
ti talk ti people. But him was a good kingman, Auntie. Yuh just had to
get ti know him t' see it."<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">" I
knew him. But you're right. He had a good heart. And he certainly loved
you, Junior and Verlene. I think it was losing the full use of his legs
that soured him. When we were children I loved him so much--we were so
close. I guess that's why it was so hard for me to be around him after
he changed. He used to talk to me in ways that made me feel so special.
That's why I always believed I could do whatever I set my mind to. Then
he turned into Oscar Madison." </font><font color="#000000">Sheree suddenly cackled. </font><font color="#ff00ff">"You two pups have no idea who Oscar Madison was do you? God...I loved that show."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra
couldn't remember if she'd ever heard her Aunt laugh with such
uninhibited joy. She didn't know who Oscar Madison was, but she didn't
have to. If he gave her Auntie so much joy in her life, he was alright
with her.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE-->
