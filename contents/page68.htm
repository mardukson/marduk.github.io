<font style="font-family: Fixed;">

<div align="left">Damian knew that if he lost the upcoming war,
Chandra, Jane, Sheree, Ada, Feifong, Elizabeth and the Iowees were
going to be alone at the mercy of Antonio.</div></font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left">But he had no intentions of losing. The Drakes were
going to pay with their lives for what they did to Janet, Mike and
Lee's people. </div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left">He wasn't the only one in his crew with that grim determination.</div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">" Chandie, I want you to take,
Jane, Feifong, Ada, Elizabeth and Janet back to the boat. Wait for us
until morning. If we don't show up at first light, sail to one of the
other Islands."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#0000ff">" No."</font><font color="#000000"> She didn't say anything else, just started walking away from him.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">" Chandie."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#0000ff">" Yuh not gwan put me through
dat again, bwoy--not knowing if yuh be dead or alive. Yuh tink I would
wan to liv' on some Island without yuh? I belong with yuh. I belong to
yuh. Where yuh go I gwan...even ti di boneyard."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#000000">She never gave him a chance to respond. He watched her back as she fast-walked to catch up to Steve.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#000000">It was ridiculous to feel the
way he did about her. No one should love anything so much that they
would instantly die, if they lost it. But that's how he loved her.
There was nothing about life and living that meant anything to him
without her. He couldn't do anything about her so he turned to the
others he wanted to stay behind.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">"Jane, it's for the sake of all
of us. Don't you see that? We have been handed a gift. Help me Jane.
Fei, Sheree...help me. Go back to the boat. Wait for us there."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#ff8000">"Ok, Damian, but hit him one time for me."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">" I will...I promise."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#ff00ff">" Tell Janet I wanted to come for her."</font><font color="#000000"> Sheree said.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">" I will."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#8000ff">" Tell Mike too...about me."</font><font color="#000000"> Feifong looked at Damian with tears in her eyes. </font><font color="#8000ff">" Tell him how much I wanted to come."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">" I'll tell him, Fei."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#0000a0">" Come back to us, Damian. Bring them all back to us."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">"We'll come back Ada."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#0000a0">" Damian...?"</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#000000">He gave his attention to her.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#0000a0">" Call me Pipsqueak?"</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#000000">After all these years she could
still come up with some of the most shameless and strangest requests.
But he sensed her strong need to bond somehow to him at this moment,
even if only by an old memory.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">" No."</font><font color="#000000"> He said softly.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#0000a0">" Why not?"</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#800080">"Because that woman back at the lab was Pipsqueak. You're Ada, and that's who you'll always be to me from now on."</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#000000">Elizabeth took the change in
plans without a fuss although she was ready and willing to fight. She
stood beside Sheree, as majestic as an Amazon, her long, curly hair
falling across her eyes.</font></div>
</font><br>
<font style="font-family: Fixed;">
<div align="left"><font color="#000000">As they headed out for their showdown with Antonio and the rest of the Drakes, Damian whispered something to Steve. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></div>
