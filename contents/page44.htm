<font size="5"><br><font size="4">They were three days out from the
Northern coast of what used to be the United States, and so far it had
been nothing but smooth sailing. When Damian stood at the bow and
stared ahead--something he loved to do--the big cat was always right
beside him. She seemed to love staring across the water as much as he
did. Ever now and then she would nuzzle him with her head, ears
quivering to be scratched. Damian would happily oblige. He had grown to
love that cat.<br><br>They rowed the boat in one hour shifts, three
shifts, four people each shift, except when it was Damian's turn to
row. He, Steve and Bruce, rowed without a fourth pair of hands.<br>
<br>
The ship was designed to cut through the water like a knife through
butter and on the calm waters it didn't take much strain to keep it
pointed where they wanted it to go. They have yet to even hoist the
sails but they still had a contingency plan in case they ran into rough
waters. <br><br><font color="#0000ff">" It's so beautiful...God's green earth." </font><font color="#000000">Chandra had joined him. The big cat's head swung over. Chandra scratched behind her ears.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"That, it is."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian nodded. </font><font color="#800080">"Almost as beautiful as you."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" Is it fair, bwoy?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Is what fair, baby?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"For me ti be so happy...so much in love...with a kingman who loves mi back?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#800080"> Why wouldn't it be? You deserve everything that's good."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"I don't know."</font><font color="#000000"> She held her head to one side and stared him in the eyes.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" Do yuh eva tink about yuh, Maddah?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Not too much anymore."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She sighed. </font><font color="#0000ff">"
I wish mi Maddah could be here. Ti know yuh. She would be so happy for
me. And mi Faddah too, in he own way, though yuh'd never know it by
listening to him."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#800080">"
I wish ma could know you. She never had any one close to her but me and
Sheree. She never saw Sheree much. You would have made ma so happy. She
would have adored you Chandie."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Really."</font><font color="#000000"> She looked at him with disbelieving eyes. Damian knew what she was thinking.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Yes,
really. Ma was deeply Christian, in the way it was taught to her. Yes,
she thought that anything healing that didn't have the u.s.d.a., stamp
of approval on it, was voodoo, but no one can spend five minutes with
you Chandie, and not see you. She would have focused on you and forgot
about everything else."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Dat meks me happy ti tink about." </font><font color="#000000">She
didn't mention that she had helped his mother die. Sheree had called
her brother because Damian's mother had no insurance, and was not being
treated seriously by the hospitals. Her brother did what he could, and
had sent her to help the woman pass easily.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"It's true."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Sumtimes,
weh I let mi mind go like yuh do, staring across dat watta, I feel like
I'm awake, dreaming. Ev'ryting dat's happening seems so fantastic, so
unreal."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" I know what you mean."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Do yuh tink we cyan haf trildren, bwoy?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" One day, if you want."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" I want to gi' di world more Damians." </font><font color="#000000">She laughed. </font><font color="#0000ff">" Lot's of Damians."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" What about Chandras. There can't be Damians without Chandras."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She twirled and let her hand run lightly across his face.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"But di Chandras cyan nuh com' out of mi belly bwoy. Maybe di Chandras com' outta Ada, Fei, or Janie."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian laughed at her silliness. </font><font color="#800080">"Maybe. You really don't want any girls?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Mi nuh wan' ti birth any Chandras for mi Damians."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" I'm serious, Chandie."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Do yuh wan' girl chile?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" It don't matter to me."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" Me neither."</font><font color="#000000"> She giggled.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Come here, you little--."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian laughed and grabbed her by the waist. He picked her up and carried her toward one of the cabins below deck.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The big cat padded off to find someone else to scratch behind her ears. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></font></div></div><font size="5"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden"> </font></font></font><div></div><!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--><font size="5"><font size="4"><font color="#000000"></font></font></font></font></body></html>
