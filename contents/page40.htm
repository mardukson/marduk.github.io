When they stopped, it was only because the sun was setting. <br>
<br>
It was late December and the nights was coming faster and colder.
Throughout their journey they had avoided taking shelter in abandoned
homes because of the risk of disease from the dead bodies and trapped
microbes--deadly remnants of an old earth that was no more.<br>
<br>
Damian still felt that there was danger inside the homes but the other
Scientists among the group agreed that after four years any risk from
lingering microbes will be too small to be concerned with. <br><br>They
were still traveling the wooded route but they passed plenty of lonely
houses and estates all the time. Directly ahead of them was another
one--a sprawling, red brick mansion; the most certain, once impeccable
lawn was overgrown with weeds and many different colors of flowers that
had grown wild. <br><br>The smell of death still lingered in the
atmosphere when they entered the house. The first skeleton they saw was
of some kind of small animal--possibly a dog. As they toured the
mansion they discovered more easily identifiable skeletons but they had
long ago, gotten used to such things. Of more importance to them were
the stonefaced fireplaces that graced two of the biggest rooms in the
mansion. </font></font><p><font size="5"><font size="4">There was no electricity, so besides being colder, it was also darker in the house than it was outside. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font size="4">They decided to camp in the large room closer to the front of the home. <br><br><font color="#800080">"I'll start a fire."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian saw that some wood was already in the wood box but it wasn't enough to keep the fire going all night.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Bruce, Alonzo...go out there and see what you can find to burn."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee ordered. The two soldiers left the room with the fluorescence lanterns they carried in their packs.<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#000000">Damian got the fire started which lit up
the entire room. Chandra started going through her bags. The smell of
herbs and spices overwhelmed the stench of decay in the air.<br><br></font><font style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);" color="#ff80ff">"Can I help you?"</font><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"> </span>Michelle was standing over Chandra's shoulders, looking into the bags. </font><font color="#ff80ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Chandra
and Jane were the ones who always prepared the meals but they were
cooking for 21 people now, instead of nine. If the gal could cook she
surely was welcome to help.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yes, thank yuh. Yuh like to cook?"<br><br style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"Love

military, I spent two years in school training to be a master chef."</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Really?" </font><font color="#000000">Jane moved closer to join the conversation. </font><font color="#ff8000">"Why did you drop out?"<br><br style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"My
mama was killed in a traffic accident and I spent the next six months
losing my mind. I was actually kicked out of culinary school. When I
got so I hated living with my father more that I liked feeling sorry
for myself, I joined the military." </span><br><br></font><font color="#000000">She
left out the part about the breakdown, the drugs, the brief period of
running wild with a group of racist skinheads. She had Negro ancestry
mixed in with about 3 different other ethnicities but her dominate
traits were Caucasian and no one could tell what ethnicity she was by
looking at her. She was so beautiful no man she ever went after, who
had to hold on to a prejudice, cared, or dared to probe too deep to
find out <i>whose</i> blood she had in her.<br><br>Chandra handed her two small bags. </font><font color="#0000ff">"Yuh tink yuh cyan do sumting with dis?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Michelle opened the bag and sniffed.</font><font color="#ff80ff"> <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"
Umm...wild cress. My mama used to cook this all the time--especially
when money was short. What part of the South are you from, Chandra?"</span></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff80ff"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Louisiana."<br><br style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"My
parents came from near there--Mississippi. I was born and raised in
Detroit but we went back so often to see my grandparents, I feel as
Southern born as my Parents.</span> </font><font color="#000000">Michelle turned to Jane. </font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"What part of the Country are you from?"</span><br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Massachusetts. Lived all my life there. But my parents came to the United States from South Africa."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian,
Lee, Steve, and Chako came in carrying a wide, heavy table from the
dining room. The ladies set their wares on the table and begin to slice
and dice. Michelle smiled at Steve.<br><br style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"Why does Steve always look so sad?

Alonzo and Bruce came noisily into the huge room. <br><br></font><font color="#400040">"Couldn't
find much heavy stuff, that didn't need an ax or chainsaw to gather,
but I think we've got enough limbs to get us through the night." </font><font color="#000000">Alonzo said to Lee.</font><font color="#400040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"That's good enough."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee said.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"Damian..."</font><font color="#000000"> Ada was over in a corner reading some papers. Damian walked over to her.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br>"
You were right. It's in the walls, the carpeting, the cabinets, the
furniture--everywhere. I think we can stay here tonight but we won't be
able to make a habit of this. These homes are poisonous to our systems."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Are you sure we can stay tonight?"<br><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"I
think so, but it might--most unlikely though-- be like contacting a
mild case of food poisoning for some of us if we stay until morning."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Well folks,</font><font color="#000000"> Damian addressed the entire crew.</font><font color="#800080"> " Let's enjoy tonight, because we're back to sleeping outdoors for the rest of our journey."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee Shrugged. </font><font color="#804040">"Why change things now anyway, we'll be on the ocean in a few months."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000">Tiararay looked at Alonzo and then at Chako. </font><font color="#004080">"We've been meaning to talk to you about that, Lee."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004080"><br></font><font color="#804040">"We?" What's this <span style="font-style: italic;">we</span> stuff? You're the only one who's afraid of sailing." </font><font color="#000000">Lee grinned at his woman.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#400040">"Not the only one, sir."</font><font color="#000000"> Alonzo said </font><font color="#400040">"I get seasick in the backyard swimming pool."<br><br></font><font color="#8080c0">"Me too,"</font><font color="#000000"> Shakira spoke. </font><font color="#8080c0">"that's why I joined the ground forces instead of the Navy?"<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"I'm worried about that myself, sir."</font><font color="#000000"> Chako's tone took on a more serious bent than the others. </font><font color="#004000">"None of us has any experience sailing model boats in the bathtub, how are we supposed to cross the Atlantic?"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"The Civs had prepared for this. We've got four experienced Sailors with us."<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"The Civs...?"</font><font color="#000000"> Chako looked around at Damian and his crew. </font><font color="#004000">"No disrespect to anyone, sir, but we're talking about the Atlantic here, not some bay on a tourist strip."<br><br><br></font><font color="#004080">"We've discussed this, Lee,"</font><font color="#000000"> Tiararay spoke softly. </font><font color="#004080">"and
we think the risk is too high. We should stay and try to rebuild here.
We'll follow your orders of course, but we all thought you should know
how we felt."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"You all?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee looked around. <br><br></font><font color="#804040">"How many of you feel that way?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian spoke up.</font><font color="#800080"> "You do know that in three years from now, a big one will hit in Africa, and the aftereffects will circle the globe? "</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#400040">"We understand what you've told us," </font><font color="#000000">Alonzo said. </font><font color="#400040">"
but who knows how strong the aftereffects will be by the time they
manifest here? We may be able to withstand them. Besides, the odds of
surviving something that <i>might</i> happen, are a whole lot greater
than trying to survive sailing across the Atlantic like 16 century
Pirates. If we had engine power, that's still risky enough, but oars,
paddles and sails--come on."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"There's
always a chance to beat the odds, but as a Scientist who has spent four
years studying the breach situation, I don't think you will survive the
aftereffects that will manifest here...but this is your lives."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian looked at Lee. </font><font color="#800080">" I think we all should have a say on what to do with our own skin. What do you say, Lee? Let's put this to a vote."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"The military isn't a democracy, Damian. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't--"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian put his hands up.</font><font color="#800080"> "--You're right. Sorry. Not my business."</font><font color="#000000"> <br><br>Damian
thought he knew what Steve and the others in his group wanted. But
maybe they were getting cold feet too. The military is not a democracy,
but the McCloud research group, is.<br><br>Damian addressed all those who started out on the new genesis with him. </font><font color="#800080">"I
think it's time I find out how all of you feel about crossing the
ocean, now that we are so close to the Harbor. Chako and Alonzo are
right. Sailing the Atlantic under nothing but man and woman power is a
great risk. Personally, I believe we can do it, but as you all know too
well, I've been wrong before. None of you have ever pledged, or signed
your life away to me, flag, Country or anything else, so you all have a
right to make this decision. Do we stay here, or do we cross the
Atlantic? </font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br>Chandie...?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Go."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Steve...?"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"We have no choice, Damian."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"There's always a choice Steve...vote."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve sighed. </font><font color="#408080">"I vote we go."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#800080">Ada...?<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" Come on Damian...what is this?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Your vote, Ada?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">"Go."</font><font color="#000000"> She threw him one of those looks from the old, early days at the lab.</font><font color="#0000a0"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Mike...?"<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"Go."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Fei...?"<br></font><font color="#000000">The little woman glanced at Bruce. His eyes registered nothing.<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Go." </font><font color="#000000">she said softly.</font><font color="#8000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">Sheree...?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Go." </font><font color="#000000">She didn't look at Isabella.</font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">Janet...?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She looked at Felix. His eyes begged her to say, stay.<br><br></font><font color="#0080ff">"Go."</font><font color="#000000"> She said after a long moment, whispering so softly, as to be almost inaudible.</font><font color="#0080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian
took a deep breath. She was his only real concern because the others
were Scientists, or at least had had the situation explained to them in
much greater detail than Janet. Some of them were in love too, but they
understood there was no future here for them.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Jane...?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Go." </font><font color="#000000">She looked at Patrick with pleading eyes.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Michelle...?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff80ff">"Go."</font><font color="#000000"> Her eyes were on Steve.</font><font color="#ff80ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"That settles it then."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian said.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"What about the Iowees?"</font><font color="#000000"> Feifong asked. </font><font color="#8000ff">"They are not military. Shouldn't they be allowed to--"<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"--The Iowees stays with us."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee's tone was stern. Most of the heads in his unit nodded their agreement.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"But--"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Fei, don't do this."</font><font color="#000000">
Damian knew how she felt--how they all felt--both his people and Lee's.
There was something about the Iowees that made you fall in love with
them--even want to fight over them. But his people couldn't win that
battle with Lee. Besides that, they didn't have the history with the
Iowees, that even Antonio's people, had. They had shed or lost no
blood. They had no claim or stake.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Feifong
looked at him hard. She read his emissions. He read their emissions.
They--all the original members of his group--were with Feifong. His
little friend did not press the issue although he sensed her anger
towards him.<br><br></font><font color="#400040">"Sir."</font><font color="#000000"> Alonzo addressed Lee. </font><font color="#400040">" I want a vote."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"Denied, soldier."<br><br></font><font color="#400040">"Then, I want to resign my commission."<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"You can't resign to me, soldier. You have to do that through the proper channels. Through me it's call mutiny and desertion."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Alonzo's voice slightly hinted of tears. </font><font color="#400040">"What
proper channels, sir? There is no channel but you. If you refuse to
release me, I won't disobey, but what right have you, sir, by what
authority?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#400040"><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee
thought about the man's words. What authority, indeed? There was no
headquarters. They hadn't been in so much as a radio contact with
anyone from Command in over four years. There was nothing out there...
nothing to bind any of them to their oaths but him. And who was he, but
a soldier just like they, whose authority is really propped up on
nothing more than the loyalty of these men and women to him,
personally, because for all any of them knew, the Higher ups, were all
dead.<br><br>Lee put his hands on the big man's shoulders. </font><font color="#804040">"Alright Big House. It's a new day. We'll take a vote."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000">Alonzo's eyes squinted and blinked. </font><font color="#400040">"Thank you, sir."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#400040"><br></font><font color="#804040">"You all understand the situation here."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee said to all his troops.</font><font color="#804040"> "And you know my position.

That's an order."<br><br></font><font color="#808040">"Then sir, I choose to go."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane walked over and took his hand.<br><br>Lee looked at Chako, who was immersed in animated conversation with Ada.<br><br></font><font color="#804040">"What's your vote, Sargent?"<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"Ada, please."</font><font color="#000000"> Ada took her hand from the young Indian's grasp.</font><font color="#004000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Chako<span style="font-style: italic;">!</span>" </font><font color="#000000">Lee called in a commanding tone.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004000">"Sir...I choose to...,"</font><font color="#000000"> he looked at Ada, whose eyes were filling up, </font><font color="#004000">" ...I choose to go." </font><font color="#000000">Ada launched herself into his arms. Alonzo's head snapped around, his face registering pure shock.</font><font color="#004000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">Tiara...how about you?"</font><font color="#000000"> Lee asked, his voice sounding strained.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0080c0">" I'm staying, Lee. We'll never make it across that water. I know it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee's voice quivered. </font><font color="#804040">"Felix...?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000080">"Jan, I love you. Stay with me baby. Don't throw your life away. Don't throw <i>us </i>away. We can stay here...have kids. Build a life."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
read what Janet was feeling and knew that he had just lost one of his
own. She had changed her mind. She walked over to Felix and hugged him
tight. The man's face glowed brighter than the fire crackling in the
firebox.<br><br></font><font color="#000080">"We're--I'm staying."</font><font color="#000000"> Felix answered Lee.</font><font color="#000080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">" Isabella...?"</font><font color="#000000"> Lee turned to where the dark-haired woman stood beside Sheree.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8080c0">"Sir...stay."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Sheree whispered. </font><font color="#ff00ff">"No!"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#8080c0">"Stay with me 'ree,"</font><font color="#000000"> Isabella begged.</font><font color="#8080c0"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian
could feel Sheree's panic like a blast of hot steam. He could feel her
looking at him, but he refused to meet her eyes. And then he heard her
mumble.</font><font color="#ff00ff"> " <small>I promised Lonetta</small>,"</font><font color="#000000"> before she said more clearly to Isabella. </font><font color="#ff00ff">"I cant."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian felt selfish for feeling so relieved. <i>He</i>
had someone to hold at night. Sheree had lost Janet and now she was
giving up Isabella for him--for ma, and yet he couldn't help being
happy for himself. He hated it. He couldn't give her anything she
needed to be happy, or to live without grinding loneliness.<br><br>He
said, despite believing Sheree made the right decision if a better
chance to live more than a few years meant more to her than love: </font><font color="#800080">"Ma wouldn't want you to do this Sheree. She loved you, and she would want you to have some happiness in life." </font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"
I promised Letta. And you know my track record, Damian. I don't know
how to keep anyone around too long, anyway. Besides that, I believe
what you say about another breach. I've come this far and lived this
long thanks to you, Chandie, and the others. I'm not going to let you
abandon me now." </font><font color="#000000">She hugged Isabella. </font><font color="#ff00ff">" Have a good life 'Bella.
