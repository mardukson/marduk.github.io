<font color="#ff0000">"Moose!"</font><font color="#000000"> Antonio thumped him hard in his broad chest with the flat of both his hands. </font><font color="#ff0000">" Get her back! Goddammit!"<br></font></big></div>

was right. They were bigger and stronger than what Damian remembered,
but they were also slower and less disciplined in their
moves--especially Rick. He kept charging at Steve like a one horned
rhino. And Steve kept sending him face first in the dirt with a
thunderous kick or a crunching, straight right hand. Finally Rick went
down and didn't get back up.<br><br>Bruce and John Huang fought at a
pace that was frantic. Both Asian Soldiers were&nbsp; quick and both
had the same level of skills. John was bigger, and unlike Antonio and
Rick and Mustafa, he evidently did his wind work as diligently as the
weight work. The kicks, punches, feints, leaps and counter moves came
so fast, it looked like each man had at least eight arms and eight
legs. Finally, John somehow managed to catch Bruce with a squatting
kick, taking his legs away from him. Bruce hit the ground and rolled to
all fours but John was right on top of him. He caught Bruce with
a&nbsp; side kick that sent him sprawling flat on his back. Then he
dove, elbow first at Bruce's neck.<br><br>Sonya hadn't entered into
that black place of pure rage yet. Michelle hit her with a couple of
hard shots that would have normally taken her there. But she didn't
want to kill her friend. She loved Michelle and was so happy to see her
again. She didn't know why they were fighting.&nbsp; Antonio gave her a
pill and told her to hit Michelle. She did it, and never thought about
Michelle hitting back. Michelle did, and years of training and
indoctrination took over Sonya's mind and body.<br>
<br>
She gave as good as she got and she could take more to get hers because
she never felt pain. Even when someone broke a bone she never felt hurt
until long after the fight was over. She didn't want to kill Michelle,
she just wanted to keep her occupied like Tony ordered. Then Michelle
struck her full in the face, with a perfect right hand counter. After
that everything went black before Sonya's eyes.<br><br><br>David
Bravefeather was gasping for air, stumbling around like a drunkard,
clutching at his throat. Chako followed him around, waiting for him to
straighten up. He had caught David with two knuckles to the windpipe,
and could have easily followed up with a neck hold. The man was as
helpless as a baby. But he was told about how Isabella and Shakira
died. <br><br>Bravefeather got some air in his lungs and stood up
straight, coughing, arms weaving around like a blind man in a haunted
house. Already, the defeat was in his eyes because he knew he had
nothing left. Chako jumped up as high as he could. Bravefeather's head
bounced against his shoulder blade and then flopped forward to rest
against his chest. He turned a three quarter circle and fell to the
ground.<br><br>Mustafa ran up on Patrick and the smaller man almost
turned and fled; instead he dropped low and got beneath the huge
Soldier, taking his legs from under him. Mustafa hit the dirt, his
broken ribs nearly paralyzing him with pain. He couldn't breath or
move, but instead of taking the fight to Mustafa, Patrick was standing
there in a defensive stance wondering why the smallest man from his
side got the biggest, scariest man from their side. He didn't follow up
his throw, too wary to be aggressive. He stood bouncing on his toes,
watching as Mustafa got up, mistaking the slowness of agony, for
menacing deliberation. <br>
<br>
This time Mustafa approached him cautiously. Patrick backed up. Mustafa
feinted a left hand hook and Patrick ducked only to catch a rock hard
knee flush on the chin.&nbsp; He was already out, but Mustafa held him
up with both hands on the side of his face and head-butted him,
crushing his scull down into his jawbone.<br><br>Chandra was clearly
out of her league with Tameka, but she managed to fight back
effectively enough to stay on her feet until Steve came over. The big
man picked Tameka up and put her in a tree. </font><font color="#408080">" Stay here and watch her Chandie. If she jumps down kick her with all your might."</font><font color="#000000"> He then turned and stalked after Mustafa.<br><br>Tameka
jumped down out of the tree, anxious to get back at Chandra, furious
that she had been given such a good fight so far, by a&nbsp; prissy Civ
like the little Barbie. She fell on all fours when she hit the ground.
She looked around for Chandra and&nbsp; the last thing she saw was a
blur of boot.<br><br><br>Damian hit Antonio and Antonio hit Damian. <br><br>Antonio
had lost a bit of his confidence when he fought Lee, unable to give
himself credit for fighting an elite warrior with a broken right arm.
Now his confidence was back in full swing. He felt good. Felt he could
fight all night. He swung at Damian with a muscled right arm that could
have knocked down the side of a barn, and narrowly missed. Damian came
back up from his duck to see Mustafa coming his way. He was having a
much harder time with Antonio than he thought he would and he knew if
he had to fight them both, he was going to be beat to death.<br><br>But
he didn't have to. Mustafa didn't see him but Damian did. Coming up
behind the big, muscle bound Soldier was the big tall johnny on the
spot, and friend of Damian. <br><br>Damian exhaled with relief.
Suddenly feeling lighter than a feather, he leaped and executed his
best move, catching Antonio flush on the chin with a double kick. He
followed that up with a series of full weight body punches that had the
long haired, Conan the barbarian, out on his feet. With one more
flying, driving kick between the breast bone and the heart, Damian
broke Antonio's ribs, driving the jagged edge of two of them deep into
the handsome man's heart.<br><br>John Huang dove and Bruce Akimota
rolled. Both men bounced to their feet and then it began again. Blow
for blow, punch for punch, kick for kick, until Chako Morningsky came
flying into the fight. He more than anyone else was on a mission of
revenge. <i>How did Mike say Felix was killed? Like this. No they toyed with him first. </i>Instead
of delivering the deadly blow he could have, he kicked John in the back
just hard enough to throw him into Bruce. Bruce sent John back to Chako
with a standing drop kick to the chest. Chako then, flipped him by his
neck over his shoulders, deciding not to sink to the Drake's level by
prolonging an uneven fight. John hit the ground dead. His spine broken
in three places.<br><br>Michelle didn't mean to kill her.<br><br>She
knew about the drugs and what happened to Sonya's baby. Janet told them
all, how Sonya had cried after she killed Tiararay. Nobody in their
group wanted to kill the disturbed woman. But hitting Sonya was like
hitting an enraged Pit-bull. You <i>had</i> to kill her to stop her
from killing you. Sonya's eyes were wide open and lifeless now, her
face a bloody pulp. Even while in the mode, Michelle fought tears as
she bent down and closed her friend's empty eyes. <br><br><br><br>After
a brief round of sparring where Steve stopped Mustafa's heart with a
roundhouse punch to the ribs, he now had Mustafa in the same neck hold
Mustafa killed Alonzo (big house) Breiner, with. <br>
<br>
Damian and all the surviving members of his unit stood watching, none
of them enjoying it but all of them eager to see how Steve finished off
the big man. This was combat, a fight to the finish, and they were all
in the&nbsp; mode that they had been drilled to enter into when in
combat.&nbsp; Steve didn't twist Mustafa's head. He choked him out and
threw him to the ground and walked away.<br><br>Chandra came over to Damian and he put an arm around her waist. She laid her head against his shoulder.&nbsp;</font><font color="#800080"> "Is Tameka dead?" </font><font color="#000000">he asked her. She shook her head.<br><br>Everyone from Antonio's side was dead except Mustafa and Tameka.<br><br>Damian lost Patrick.<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"</font><font color="#004080">Damian."</font><font color="#400080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian whirled around like he had heard a bullet whiz by his head.<br><br>Mike was limping towards him with Janet by his side.<br><br>Damian almost didn't recognize him and the only thing that really identified Janet to him was her million dollar smile.<br><br>All
the crew rush over to them. Damian approached slower, him and Mike
holding eye contact while the others reveled in their joyous reunion.
Janet was ecstatic as she hugged each of her friends. <br><br></font><font color="#004080">"Where is the cat you told me about?"</font><font color="#000000"> Mike said when Damian got closer.</font><font color="#004080"> " I'd like to meet her."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian
looked at his misshapen face, the empty left eye socket, the crushed
nose, the misaligned jaw. He thought about Shakira, thought about how
Mike stayed alive through all the physical and mental pain just for
Janet. Thought about how even through all his own sorrows, Mike had
cared enough about a friend to concentrate enough to contact him from
across four days of ocean.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Right now I don't know and I don't care. Right now, all I want to do is hug my little brother."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Mike took an unsteady step towards him and Damian went the rest of the way, enfolding him in a heartfelt embrace.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You still with me?"</font><font color="#000000"> Damian whispered.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004080">"Yeah"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"You're going to stay with me?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004080">"Yeah."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Let's go...there's somebody who's eager to see you again, back at the boat."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);" color="#ff80ff">"What do we do about them?" </font><font color="#000000">Michelle pointed to Tameka and Mustafa.</font><font color="#ff80ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">" There's plenty of food on this Island for two people. </font><font color="#000000">" Damian said.</font><font color="#800080"> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The
killing mode was broken by hearing Mike's voice after so long. Damian
was now tired and feeling something about the killing done this day
that he never felt about the killings done at the slave compound. All
he wanted to do now, was get back on the water and just sail.</span>&nbsp; "Chako, you and Bruce go find Sheba. We'll be waiting for you at the boat."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#004000">" Yes, sir."</font><font color="#000000"> Chako and Bruce started off to search the south side of the woods where the cat had entered. <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></big></div>
