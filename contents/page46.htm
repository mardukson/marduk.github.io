<div align="left">They reached the first of the West Indie Archipelagos
in six days like Steve projected. None of them felt any real hunger
pangs even though the food ran out in the time span Jane predicted.
That was something to think about because Damian felt it would be
useful to know if their ability to comfortably go without food for so
long, was due to being vegetarians, the changed earth conditions, or
the alterations to their systems. Later he will get the crew to help
him do some in-depth research on it. <br><br>It was early in the day
when they arrived, so they were able to begin exploring the Islands
immediately. They anchored the boat close to the coast and set out. <br><br><font color="#8080ff">"Which Island is this?"</font><font color="#000000"> Feifong asked.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" Dis is Trinidad,"</font><font color="#000000"> Chandra answered. "</font><font color="#0000ff">Mi Faddah was born here."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian, who had never left mainland U.S. before, was stunned at how different the Island looked from what he had imagined.<br><br>It was a beautiful place, but from the time they got 10 yards inland they were seeing modern buildings. He expected more jungle.<br><br>There
was an eerie silence to the beautiful little spot in the world. They
weren't seeing any signs of life--not even of animals.<br><br>The big
cat--as if she had gone stir crazy on the boat--shot off like a bullet
as soon as her paws touched land. They all watched her as she
disappeared in the distance, running and sniffing, sniffing and
running. The Iowees were also running wild in a way. They were in
bliss--laughing and playing, rolling around in the grass.<br><br>The
farther inland they walked, the more skeletons they were coming across.
Damian had entertained thoughts of setting up camp on the Island for a
while but Chandra was emitting so much sorrow, even the Soldiers seemed
to sense it, though she said nothing, and her face expressed nothing
any different than usual.<br><br></font><font style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);" color="#808000">" It stinks of death here, even more than back in the States."</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);" color="#000000"> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Steve said.</span> </font><font style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);" color="#808000">" Let's stock up and get away from here." </font><font color="#000000">His
eyes were on Chandra, full of puzzlement as they tried to match what
she was emitting emotionally, to the expression he saw on her face.</font><font color="#808000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>They
all agreed that they should set sail for one of the other Islands as
soon as they gathered some food. Chandra, Jane, and Michelle went about
the task. The pickings weren't abundant. They were in the wildest part
of the Island but as they walked along the coast, they saw that things
weren't getting any greener or more fruitful. <br><br></font><font color="#008080">" Let's go back." </font><font color="#000000">Steve urged again. </font><font color="#008080">"We
just need enough food to last for a day. The Antilles group isn't far
from here. We'll find plenty of what we need there. Should be able to
stay there a while too."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
called Chandra with his thoughts. Ten minutes later she came back with
Jane and Michelle. They were carrying nearly empty bags.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">" Not too much to find here." </font><font color="#000000">Jane said to Damian.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">" That's one of the reasons we're leaving."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian turned from Jane and whistled loudly. Soon the Iowees were back with them.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"Wonder where Sheba is?"</font><font color="#000000"> Feifong said.</font><font color="#8080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve looked over all their heads into the distance </font><font color="#008080">" I don't know, but Sheba' ta get her feline ass back here."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#004000">" We need a signal for her like we have for the Iowees."</font><font color="#000000"> Chako said.</font><font color="#004000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian sighed. </font><font color="#800080">" Alright...let's go find the cat."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Sheba!"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Sheeebaaa!"<br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">"Sheba!"<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Sheeeba!"<br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">"Shebah!"<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"Shebaaah!"<br><br></font><font color="#004000">"Sheeeebaaaaaaaah!"<br><br></font><font color="#ff80ff">"Sheba!"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Shebaaaaaaaaaaaa"<br><br><i></i></font><i><font size="3"></font><font color="#000000">"Sheeeeba!, Sheeeeba!"<br><br></font></i><font color="#000000"><font size="3"></font><font color="#0000a0">"Sheeeeeba!"<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Shee-<i>itt!"</i><br><i><br></i></font><font color="#000000">Michelle
playfully rolled her eyes at Steve. Just then the big cat came bounding
up. It stopped in front of everybody and sat. Then she yawned, and
after the Iowees got off her neck, she stood up and shook, walked
passed everybody with her head straight up in the air.<br><br>Steve looked at Damian and back at the cat who was heading towards the boat.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Well, exscuuuse us." <!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></div>
