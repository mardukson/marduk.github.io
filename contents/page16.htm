pulled his black, 1998 T-bird into the parking lot at the back of
McCloud's Lab. Before he stepped out of the car the old man was
hobbling toward him with a pronounced limp that Damian had never
noticed before. The little thin lips flattened and the spotted teeth
beamed a big welcome.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Typical scientific genius, Damian thought. Too busy and occupied to comb his hair or brush his damned teeth. </font></font></font><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Damian...Come, come...I want to introduce you to your team."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><i>I'm coming pops...Damn.</i> </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
picked up his pace. When he wanted to, the old man moved like he was on
motorized wheels. Before he knew it, Damian was walking into a room of
what he instantly saw, felt, sensed, were some very unhappy Campers. Or
maybe it was the utterly disgusted voice that smacked him in the face
that told him that there was no joy in McCloud's lab.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">"Oh you, <i>can't </i>be serious."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
accent was English or maybe Afrikaner. Damian felt so verbally
assaulted, he had to play the man's words over in his mind twice to
believe he hadn't just been cussed at. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">And
then they were all talking at once, each raising the tone of
incredibleness in their expressions of discontent like a high stakes
poker game. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">What
was happening was exactly what Damian expected. He looked over at
McCloud and felt sorry for the old man as he stood there red-faced and
speechless. But he had squared things with McCloud by showing up. He
will take one of the other opportunities offered him with a crystal
clear conscience. He wasn't mad. He understood the people in the room
completely. He probably would have felt the same way, himself. No hard
feelings he thought. That was, until a high, but piercing little voice
chimed out loud enough for Sheree and the entire campus to hear.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">"A fucking, <i>boy!</i>" </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">the
voice shrilled, in an incredulous tone that couldn't have been topped
if they had kept trying to one-up one another for the next 50 years.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">They
had a right to their anger. And they had a right to let McCloud know he
was wrong--which even Damian felt he was-- but they had no grounds to
assault him so vehemently. This was McCloud's idea. He was about to
leave and bless them on the way out but now his eyes sought out the
owner of that dog whistle voice. He spotted a very well proportioned
young woman standing in the midst of the disgruntled scientists like a
top heavy Napoleon Bonaparte. He had never seen bigger tits in his life
and for a moment he got lost in the miracle of the spectacle; forgot
all about being insulted.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Truly two of the nine wonders of the world, they are."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"What--?"</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian turned to see a very, <i>very</i> tall red-haired Viking grinning down at him. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He grinned back sheepishly.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Don't

but the eyes did not fail to bulge as is right and proper in such
a--shall I say--wondrous first encounter."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian burst out laughing just as McCloud finally found his lost voice. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">"</font><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">Everybody be <i>quiet</i>!"</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> The old man thundered. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The room fell silent.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Damian...son forgive me...I thought I had prepared them.

looked at the old man, who he was growing to like more all the time. He
wasn't blaming McCloud and he tried to convey that with his eyes. In
fact, he wasn't even angry. He was just anxious to be on his way.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"I thank you for being so kind to me sir, and offering me such a great opportunity."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
was moving towards the door before he was finished speaking. Slow
talking McCloud will never catch him with a plea before he was halfway
down the hall and he knew it. But when he reached out for freedom,
instead of cold, hard doorknob, his hand landed on long, tall, Viking
skin. The comical Bill Walton had leaned over without moving his feet
and gotten between Damian and the exit.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"Before you go, I think you are due a few more apologies."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><i>Did it look like I needed anymore apologies? </i></font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"That's OK, I'll just be on my---"</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Nooo...Damian...son, please don't leave!

was jolted by the panicked tone of McCloud's voice. He could see he
wasn't the only one in the room disturbed by such naked desperation.
People were losing it all around. He wanted out.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian lowered his hand and sighed deeply.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Sir, I don't think it's fair or proper--"</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Damian...son, we don't have time for fair and proper...or for catering to bruised egos." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">McCloud looked around the room fiercely--like the alpha male wolf daring another contender to step up and go for it.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Welcome...," </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">McCloud demanded of the people in the room,</font><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"the new lead scientist of McCloud's research group...and <i>your</i> new boss."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">"Be goddamned if he's <i>my</i> new boss." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
big breasted woman muttered too low for anybody as far away as McCloud
was from her possibly to hear. The old man's head whipped around like a
cobra strike.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"You <i>say</i> something, Ada?"</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">"No...sir." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Ada looked down at the floor.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">McCloud
started tapping his old scuffed up, weather worn shoe, getting louder
with each contact with the floor. The toe taps started to tense the air
like a time bomb, counting down the last ten seconds before the big
boom. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">As much as they hated it, people started to move.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#808000" face="Times New Roman">"Welcome, sir." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The Englishman or Afrikaner, stepped forward and extended a hand to Damian.

Damian shook it and he couldn't tell if it was inadvertent or not when
the man turned and wiped the hand&nbsp; he just shook, on his lab coat.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#400080" face="Times New Roman">"Welcome to the Lab, Marson." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">This was a bull-necked, stocky man who looked liked a slightly undersized Mike Ditka.

grabbed Damian's hand and for a second squeezed like the two of them
were engaged &nbsp;in some kind of arm wrestling match. He let go and
stepped back smirking like he had just proven something.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">A
tall, light haired woman, who was wearing a skirt so short, Damian was
sure that if she turned around, he could see where her ass ended and
her legs began even when she was standing up straight. An amusing thing
was, her tiny, customized lab coat was even shorter than her skirt.
Damian didn't hear but one female voice during the brouhaha, so he
wasn't sure if she had joined in the noise against him or not. She
extended her hand towards him like she expected him to kiss it.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#ff0080" face="Times New Roman">"Welcome aboard, sir.

</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
had learned things about older women that left him nearly uninterested
in younger ones. He knew they didn't play coy when they wanted
something. Like Sheree, the woman was a well preserved older woman;
slim and tight. She grabbed his hand like women take hold of a
penis--running her palm lightly down from his wrist to his finger tips.
</font></font></font></font></p>
<p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">A
short, skinny, Woody Allen type approached Damian in a manner that was
clearly more intended to interrupt something than to welcome Damian.
Nearly pushing the blond woman off balance, he croaked his greeting and
stepped back quickly;said his name was Timothy Littlepage. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
tall Viking introduced himself as Steve Gunthor; gave Damian a look
that could have been a picture in the dictionary next to the word
"sincerity" as he loudly welcomed him as </font><font class="fsx06" color="#008080" face="Times New Roman">"boss."</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">After
two other men obeyed McCloud's demand, the only other woman in the room
stepped forward. Damian was already calling her the "Pipsqueak" in his
mind. She didn't extend her hand but she did manage to grunt out a
greeting even though it was only a welcome by definition of the words--
in intent and expression the woman had cussed him out again. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She never mentioned her name. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian laughed and grinned at Mr. McCloud, who smiled back in obvious relief, his eyes urging Damian to take charge. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian
looked around the room--still undecided until his glance fell on Steve.
The big oaf was going through a series of facial contortions that would
have rivaled the best of Jim Carrey. The 7 footer managed somehow to
make himself look like a 3 foot tall, sad-eyed 6 year old one second
and an excited puppy, the next. He was wriggling his massive reared in
a pretty good imitation of a tail wagging hound. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian wasn't the only one who erupted with laughter.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"You know you ought to take <i>that</i> out on the road." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian wiped his eyes and shook his head. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The big clown straightened up and laughed. Damian had seen plenty of people laugh before but this guy <i>laughed. </i>His
eyes narrowed into slits. His teeth looked like they popped out of his
mouth and started clattering independently from his face. His whole
body morphed into a definition of the word laugh. His guffaws cackled
like Zeus or Thor or something else from up high. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian watched in bemused fascination.<i> What he said just wasn't that funny.

the intention of all that clowning was to convince him to accept the
position, it worked. Damian knew he had a least one potential friend in
the lab. As anxious as he was to settle in some place and get to work,
one person in this crew who didn't despise him was enough.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Alright." &nbsp;</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He said</font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">.
