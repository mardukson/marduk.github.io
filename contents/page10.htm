But she should have told us how little time the Doctor gave her to live. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">Nobody
ever truly conceives&nbsp; that they are going to die and I understand that
Lonetta might have wanted Damian to get settled in at school and
everything before she told him. She probably thought that she had at
least that much time. Still--the look on Damian's face when they told
him his mother was dead, was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever
seen. And believe me; I've seen a lot of sad things in my life. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">The
truly remarkable thing was how he recovered almost as soon as he
crumbled. At first it looked like he was going to be a basketcase and
then--in an instant, he went from falling down on his knees in grief,
to standing up so tall and kingly, for a moment I didn't even recognize
him. He looked like he was thirty instead of 18. </font></font></font></font></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">He wiped his eyes and I never saw another tear. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">We spent two weeks in Virginia making arrangements for the burial. Damian handled everything--and I mean <i>everything--</i>including the eulogy and the burial. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">That eulogy... </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">Lordy,
people were dragging away from that cemetery, afterwards, like they had
been up for two weeks without rest or sleep. I mean they were <i>just drained. </i></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">It was&nbsp; crazy. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">The
first part of that dedication had everybody crying as if everything
that has happened since the breach was bottled up inside and we've been
waiting for that moment to just let it all go. Some people cried
themselves sick. People were puking and getting stomach spasms. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">Then,
when I thought I was dead on my feet from emotion, that boy started
talking about what a good woman Lonetta was, and people were shouting
and stomping their feet. By the time he finished, I swear it was like
Jesus had come back. Everybody was just euphoric--laughing, singing and
just...happy. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">I
will never forget it as long as I live. Something happened out there. I
don't know what it was. I've been an Atheist for 25 years but that day
I saw Damian transform all those people with nothing but the naked
force of his own soul projection. He wasn't promising them anything,
giving them anything or saving them from anything. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">Yet,
he had people forgetting who, what and where they were;had them rising
above the limitations of their own minds, bodies and souls. It was so
beautiful and powerful. <br>
</font></font></font></font></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4">Suddenly, I'm believing in Jesus again for the first time since I was a teen-ager. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><i>Letta, I know you will never understand. </i></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><i>But

didn't come as a complete surprise, though. I've been following how the
breach affected different people. I've also done some preliminary
research on how certain circumstances and surroundings contributed to
the harm that was done to people by the breaches. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">Ma's damned near white.

didn't want to accept it, but I knew I was going to lose her. I guess
that's why after the initial shock, I decided not to get too bent up
over ma's death. She wouldn't have wanted me wallowing in self-pity. Ma
always acted like she thought I was the next best thing to the,
Almighty.&nbsp; Now she's gone. But so are millions of other innocent,
beautiful people like her. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">The
only thing that I can do for ma, now, is try to live up to some of that
faith she always had in me--that I would do something great in the world. I don't
know if I can do even little things to help people and make a
difference, but I'm damn sure going to try my best to do <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span> with ma looking down at me from up there. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">I
don't know what got into me yesterday, though, at ma's funeral...up
there preaching like some jackleg biblethumper. All I intended to do,
was give a brief speech from the heart about how much ma meant to me.
Next thing I know, I was in another zone--words pouring out of my mouth
that I never meant to say. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">The
real crazy thing was how the people's reaction to my words affected me.
It's hard to explain, but the more I talked--the more they reacted--the
more I began to lose the sense of who, and where I was. It was like the
people and I were merging into one being. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">Dawg,
I was really into those people and I have never in my life felt such
unity with people. That has got to be what it felt like back in the day
when everybody spoke one language. I had those people crying like
babies and they had me glowing like the sun. I felt so much like I
wanted to do something, give something...I don't know...I wanted to
gather those people up and just protect them from everything. I felt
like dying, because I had reached the pinnacle of emotional experience.
I know now it isn't that hard to be a Martyr when you've got people
sending you that kind of energy. When people are that open and
vulnerable, you just want to give them everything you've got. That's
why I started joking and trying to get them to get those tears out of
their hearts. I couldn't stand the thought of them feeling sorrow. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">There
were only about 80 people out there yesterday and they had me wanting
to go heads up with Godzilla on their behalf. I used to look at this
world and every time I heard one of those Jacklegs talking about how
Jesus loves me, I always felt like kicking them in the teeth because I
hate for somebody to lie to me in the face of all evidence. I know
people are going to lie, and it don't bother me much except when they
insult my intelligence with it. I haven't seen any evidence of any
loving Jesus in this world or any love period, except for what
individuals have for each other. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">After yesterday...I know there<i> is</i> love. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">Those
lying Jacklegs are telling the truth despite themselves. Jesus has got
to be ate up with love. There's no way, he could have absorbed all that
feeling and emotion from so many people all these years and not be
crazy in love. Even if they're crying to the wrong Jesus, the real one
knows what's meant for him. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">You
know what it's like when you're crazy in love? Yesterday I wanted to
crush every thing that ever gave those people at my ma's funeral a
single moment of pain. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">There
is going to be some major asswhipping going on when Jesus comes back.
He's going to be hunting high and low, and he's going to be digging
under goddamned worms. For the first time in my life I know that nobody
is getting away with a single crime against a WoManbeing, because I
know now how Jesus feels. </font></font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="6"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan"><font size="2"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New RoMan">Sheree
