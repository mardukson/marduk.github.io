<p>Both Steve and Chandra were right, which means both were also wrong.
There were 5 men like Chandra said, and 4 women, but there were no
children, and that is where Steve came in the winner's circle. There;
and in his belief that the other survivors were somehow connected with
the government.<br><br>What Chandra thought were children were actually
two full grown adults--a male and a female--both about three feet tall.
But they weren't little people, or dwarfs, they were something
governmental, because they weren't anything natural looking--not to the
earth anyway.<br><br>The more natural looking men were in uniform and
carrying heavy hi-tech weapons, and so were the women. More indications
of governmental connections. Damian wondered who was running this show;
if the big Cheeses were still hanging in there, in their underground
penthouses.<br><br>NASA was at least as smart as the McCloud research
group. He wondered if they had found a means to adjust artificially to
the changes that were coming over the earth. It was NASA, who was the
biggest reason, his group found the pattern, and so had a greater
chance to survive. He had always pondered why the space agency sent
them that software. The McCloud research group--at least while he
headed them, had no projects with the government. The package had come
to them out of the blue. <br><br>Was there some ulterior motive for
him receiving the software? Was he and his group experimental guinea
pigs, chosen all along to survive...like the Iowees, and these Special
Forces soldiers? His group--like it seemed that every unit having to do
with the U.S. government, were-- was of a diverse racial and ethnic
makeup. <br>
</p>
<p>Was Harvard and McCloud's fanatical pursuit of him, all about
science and his book, or was there something more to it--less
flattering to his ego than what appeared? McCloud is dead, so he knew
he will never really find the answers to his questions, but the
questions were just another step on his way to opening his eyes to the
real world, the bigger picture, and how little people had ever really
known about themselves and the world they lived in. The pettiness they
enmeshed themselves in, when ultimately life is about survival--the
goal is to live in some kind of security, dignity, and peace, but the
only basic reason to life is to survive, and in the long run no one
with any power cares about your survival because they are too involved
with insuring their own, and doing whatever it takes to continue their
method of survival in the way they were accustomed to.<br><br>The male
soldiers were all the exact same six foot plus, height. One was Nordic,
one Latino, one Asian, one African, and one American Indian.<br><br>The
women were the same clone-like variations of the WoMan species as the
men, except all, but one of them, were about 4 inches shorter than the
men. There was an African, a Nordic, a mixed-blood, and a Latino.<br><br>The
U.S. military always was the most inclusive institution in the United
States. When it came to training people to project death around the
world, the Nation never seemed to have had the problems with race that
it did with everything else.<br><br>Damian was never worried about guns
before, but he was looking at the U.S. government here, probably NASA
genius. The guns just might work. <br><br>And at that moment 9 of them were pointed at him. <br><br>He
had decided-- through stern assertion of his prerogative as leader of
the McCloud research group-- to approach the other survivors alone--to
see if they were Friendlies or Hostiles. At the moment, they were
hostile.<br><br><font color="#ff0000"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Don't move!</span>" </font><font color="#000000">the Latino soldier shrilled, all out of proportion to what Damian thought was necessary to convey his order.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>He
was an extremely handsome man, white-skinned, but clearly Latino, or
maybe Italian; looked almost like he was genetically designed from a
mixture of Clark Gable and Rita Mareno, with a dash of Arnold
Schwarzenegger thrown in for seasoning. In fact, they all--the men and
women-- looked like they were designed by using the genes of matin&eacute;e
idols from their own prospective groups. The African looked like his
father may have been the young Muhammad Ali, and his mother, super
model Imani. The Nordic looked like he might have been a spawn of Rolph
Lundgren and Marilyn Monroe. The Asian had the same model looks and
powerful build as the others. The American Indian was the most striking
figure of them all, looked like he had leaped off the cover of one of
those cheap, romance paperbacks.<br><br>The mixed-blood female soldier
was almost as tall as the men; short description would be Angelina
Jolie, but darker, with wider, lighter eyes. She had the kind of exotic
beauty that legends are made of.<br><br>The African woman was actually
African American, unlike her male counterpart, who, even though he
resembled a young Muhammad Ali, had that distinct air of a Continental
transplant who for some reason, had come across the ocean and signed
his soul over to the U.S. military. She was a shade or two darker, but
otherwise, the near splitting image of Halle Berry, the movie Actress,
except she was, incredibly, even more beautiful. <br><br>The female
soldier, he called Nordic, because of her blond hair and light eyes,
was more stunning than Jane in the face. Jane was slightly taller, and
had a more voluptuous body, but this woman, like her compatriots,
carried a beauty that seemed somehow artificial.<br><br>The Latino woman resembled Janet, to the point of being a twin, except she was a few inches taller.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"My name is Damian Marson."<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" Where the <i>fuck </i>did you come from?"</font><font color="#000000"> The Latino male soldier, barked.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br><i>Whoa. What the hell did you walk into here, Damian?</i><br><i><br></i></font><font color="#800080">" I'm a survivor...of the breach. I've been traveling for three years--heading south."<br><br></font><font color="#008040">"Bull<i>shit</i>!" </font><font color="#000000">This was the male Nordic soldier. He spat tobacco in Damian's direction.</font><font color="#008040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008040">"No one from the States, survived that breach.</font><font color="#000000">" The Nordic's ice blue eyes narrowed.</font><font color="#008040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Just shoot the moodafoooka,"</font><font color="#000000"> the African said.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The Indian pointed his gun at Damian's forehead.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"You do that, and I'm going to snap these two little Tonka toys in half." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian&nbsp;
looked towards the voice he instantly recognized, and felt like breaking
out in song when he saw Steve.&nbsp; The giant was holding up the two
Anomalies, one in each hand, their spindly little legs dangling in the
air, kicking wildly.<br><br>The Latino soldier's eyes got big, as if they were
going to self-destruct his face. He started to stutter and repeat, like
a CD with a hairline crack in it. </font><font color="#ff0000">"St-st-stand d-d-ddown." </font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000">He took too long getting the order out, and the Women, in unison, swung their weapons from Damian to Steve.<br><br></font><font size="4"><font color="#008040">"Point those weapons down, Goddammit! You stupid bitches!" </font><font color="#000000">the
male, blond soldier screamed. One of the female soldiers--the black
one--shot flame from her eyes at the Nordic and Damian had no doubt as
he watched her face that if the situation weren't suddenly, so unfavorable for
their group she would have flew at him with fists swinging.</font><font color="#008040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040">"Loook, what do you guys want? " </font><font color="#000000">The
African GI-Joe was sweating bullets. Looking at Steve, it was clear to
the African that the newcomers weren't Special Forces. Damian was an
acceptable candidate, but there was no way any Special Forces group
would accept in their ranks someone as big and tall as the redheaded
guy. The enemy would see him coming from China. <i>They</i> should have seen him coming. After so long a time of fighting nothing but boredom, they had grown inexcusably lax.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">
Damian didn't understand how things turned so fully in his favor, but
he could clearly see that they had, and it had everything to do with
Steve and the two little creatures he held in his big hands.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br><br><br><img title="" alt="" src="../../new%20genesisNp/contents/.%5Cimage42.jpg" height="150" width="200"> <font size="2">Steve after three years in a changed solar system</font><br><br><br>Obviously the two little creatures were more
important to these guys than a vault full of five star Generals. How
Steve knew that, he had no idea. He had no idea that Steve had followed
him. He had badgered the group into agreeing that the best way to
handle this was not to seem threatening to these people on first
contact. Steve, in his transfigured state, would have looked
threatening to a tribe of Hulk Hogans.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Nothing <i>now," </i></font><font color="#000000">Steve spat in response to the black soldier's question. He reached out to the Native American soldier.</font><font color="#408080"> "Give me <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>." </font><font color="#000000">The
Indian's dark eyes shifted from Steve to the Latino, who appeared to be
the group's commanding officer. After a moment, he thrust the gun out
at Steve. </font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve put the E.T, he held in his right hand, in his other hand with its match and took the weapon.<br>He pointed it in the air and fired it. The gun hissed and emitted a puff of smoke which floated into the Indian's stoic face. <br><br></font><font color="#008040">"What the fu--" <br><br></font><font color="#000000">The Nordic pointed his gun in the air and pulled the trigger. The gun puffed.<br><br>They
hadn't fired the weapons in more than a year and after so long a time
of seeing nothing threatening, had stopped expecting too.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"All he wanted to do."</font><font color="#000000"> Steve's voice was emotional.</font><font color="#408080"> "is ask if we could join you people. And you were going to shoot him down like a rabid dog."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve looked at the black soldier and scowled. </font><font color="#408080">"Damian, go over there and take one. Knock his ass out."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
glanced over at the second coming of the greatest of all time, and
decided to pass on the opportunity. He nodded to the two little Beings,
who were both crying. </font><font color="#800080">"Let them go Steve."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#408080">"If I were you I would have taken <i>two.</i>" </font><font color="#000000">Steve
glared at the Indian before setting the two small Beings on the ground
and letting them go. They scurried over to where the male Latino
soldier stood.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"If <i>you</i> were me, I would have taken <span style="font-style: italic;">five</span>."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian joked. He glanced in Steve's eyes and immediately wished he hadn't.<i> Don't go into a routine...please don't do a routine. </i></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><i><font color="#000000"><br></font></i><font color="#408080">" Don't worry Boss."</font><font color="#000000">
It was harder to read each other's thoughts with so many strangers, and
heightened emotions around, but he knew he was emitting so strong, his
thoughts would have reached Steve in the eye of a Hurricane.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" Look, we're sorry," </font><font color="#000000">the Latino soldier said.</font><font color="#ff0000"> "We are under orders."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"To shoot a man just for showing his face?" </font><font color="#000000">Steve's voice was an octave higher than normal.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"No.
To protect our Charges at all cost. We thought he was Special Forces. I
shouldn't tell you Civs this, but there are factions within factions,
running the U.S. government and they all don't have the same agenda."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"What U.S. government? There <i>is</i> no U.S. government. There is no longer an U.S." <br><br></font><font color="#804040">"You don't know that," </font><font color="#000000">the African said.</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve's head whipped around. </font><font color="#408080">"<i>You</i>. Don't. Talk. To. Me...<i>Understand?</i>"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000">The African threw his hands up. He addressed Damian. </font><font color="#804040">"
I really <span style="font-style: italic;">am</span> sorry, sir. Some of us have been killed by the other side
and we didn't think there were anybody left alive on the surface, but
us and them."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#408080">"He wasn't carrying a gun." </font><font color="#000000">Steve pointed out loudly, unwilling to let bygones be bygones...yet."</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The Asian male soldier laughed.<br><br></font><font color="#0080ff">"You have no idea what kind of technology we have." </font><font color="#000000">He pulled a button off his shirt which responded to the tug unlike any material Damian had ever seen before.</font><font color="#0080ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>He held the button up.<br><br></font><font color="#0080ff">"You know what this is."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"A
deceptive, micro-explosive, atomically depressed fusion device capable
of blowing up three Chinese restaurants, two small countries in South
America and the Eiffel tower in a single bound?" </font><font color="#000000">Steve said, sounding like a cross between the narrator of the Superman monologue and a game show host.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>All the government Flunkies laughed.<br><br></font><font color="#0080ff">"Actually that's not too far-off the mark," </font><font color="#000000">the Asian soldier responded. </font><font color="#0080ff">"This
baby has a destructive radius of more than 200 yards. With one of
these, he could have blown us all to pieces with a flick of the wrist."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Well,
that might have been so three year ago, but I will bet you fifty
seashells and a blue pebble, that thing couldn't blow a tsetse fly off
course now." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">The Asian soldier's smug look fell into confusion<br><br></font><font color="#0080ff">"What the hell are you talking about?"<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Activate it and throw it,"</font><font color="#000000"> Steve dared.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0080ff">"You're crazy"<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Throw it," </font><font color="#000000">the Latino officer ordered</font><font color="#ff0000"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span><br><br></font><font color="#000000">The Asian Adonis shrugged. He ran forward a distance and threw the button bomb as far as he could.<br><br>Everybody waited. Nothing happened.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Do <i>anything</i> we have work?" </font><font color="#000000">The Nordic female soldier asked; the thought of their discarded communication devices suddenly fresh in her mind.</font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"Probably not," </font><font color="#000000">Steve responded. </font><font color="#408080">"Don't you ultimate warriors ever test your stuff?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The blond woman sidled up next to Steve.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Not lately. But hopefully, that's about to change soon." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">The other females snickered, leering like Pirates.<br><br>Damian addressed the Leader of the soldiers.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You said that you and another group were knocking each other off. Do you think there are anymore of them left?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"We
didn't kill them all. Unless they died off naturally, or were killed by
something else...which I doubt...yeah they are still out there
somewhere, but we haven't seen any of them in over a year. The last
time we counted, there were about 10 of them."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"We haven't seen any signs of them either, " </font><font color="#000000">Damian said. He sensed Steve wanting to tell him something.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you think?" </font><font color="#000000">He asked the big man.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"I'm thinking; how do we know these are the good guys, and the other group is the bad guys? <i>They</i> didn't try to shoot you for no reason."<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Believe me, they would have" </font><font color="#000000">the Latino male answered.</font><font color="#ff0000">
"It's been shoot on sight between us since the breach...right up until
they stopped chasing us for some reason. The only reason we didn't
shoot you on sight sir, is because you approached us in a way that was so
confusing." </font><font color="#000000">He turned from Damian to Steve.</font><font color="#ff0000"> "As for the bad guy, good guy thing...sir, both us, and our enemies are Soldiers. We are simply carrying out our orders."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"That's the whole problem," </font><font color="#000000">Steve sneered</font><font color="#408080">.
"How many of us are left on earth? And you guys are bumping each other
off because of some orders you got from a bunch of pretentious mafia
Dons, who right now are probably all deader than Al Capone." </font><font color="#000000">Steve walked over to Damian.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"Let's go, boss. It's getting harder and harder to breathe around here."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian fell in stride beside him.</font><font color="#800080"> "Thanks."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#408080">"For what?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You know...saving my life."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve stopped.</font><font color="#408080">" I knew the guns wouldn't work." </font><font color="#000000">He sighed.</font><font color="#408080">
"You told me we were in this together;that we had to count on each
other like no man had ever counted on another. I took that to heart.
But I guess you were just talking."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#800080">"I'm sorry."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Never should have gone off like that without me Damian. Who are you playing hero for?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I know---"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Wait!" </font><font color="#000000">Both
Steve and Damian turned at the same time. The Nordic female soldier was
running towards them. The African American female soldier was close
behind her.</font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"We want to go with you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve asked:<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"But
what about your orders? Your mission? Your Charges. The red, white and
blue, tis of thee and all that? How are you two just going to cut out
and hitchhike with us? "<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"We decided that what you said made a lot of sense," </font><font color="#000000">the black female soldier said. The white woman nodded in agreement.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Your superior officers are just going to let you dessert like that?" </font><font color="#000000">Damian asked.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Yes." </font><font color="#000000">The Nordic woman answered him.</font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"Why?" </font><font color="#000000">Steve demanded, his tone dripping with suspicion.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The black woman responded:<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Because they think you made a lot of sense too. We all want to join with you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Exactly what Damian had hoped for.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Alright boss." </font><font color="#000000">Steve could sense that Damian had made his decision even though the thing still had to be put to a vote.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"But I have to tell you...I don't like it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian addressed the two women. </font><font color="#800080">"There
are others in our group. We have to get their opinion. Go back and tell
your people to camp where they are for a day. If our group decides to
join yours, we'll meet you in the morning...my Name is Damian."</font><font color="#000000"> He extended his hand. The black female took it first. She sprung up straighter than an arrow.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Jones, Tameka, sir. Pleased to meet you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Like the black one, the white woman all but saluted.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8080">"Ashinov, Mesha. Pleased to meet you, sir."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8080"><br></font><font color="#408080">"Good <i>god,"</i> </font><font color="#000000">Steve muttered; gave a disgusted look to Damian before saying: </font><font color="#408080">"Gawwwwllee Sergeant Carter. Hows come yawl neva' tolt' me I wast in dee Ahhmee?" </font><font color="#000000">He held out a hand to the women.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">Pyle...Gomer. Pleast ter meet yawl."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">As the women enjoyed the upside of getting to know Steve, which Damian knew was just warming up, he said to the women:<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"That's Steve."<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I's
