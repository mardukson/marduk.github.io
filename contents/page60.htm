<div align="left"><font color="#008080"><font size="4">" You mean <i>sacrifice,</i> sacrifice?"<font color="#000000"> Steve asked for the tenth time. Chako stopped responding after the fourth time.<font color="#008080"><br><font color="#000000"><br>Damian,
Chandra, Bruce, Feifong, Ada, Chako, Steve, Sheree, Patrick, Jane,
Elizabeth, and Michelle, were armed with bows, spears and knives as
they advanced on the compound. Their faces were painted dark as Bruce
instructed. <br><br>Chako told Damian about his observation that the
soldiers only came out at night. There was at least four more hours of
darkness left. Damian expected to be through with this night's work
long before then.<br><br>He, Steve and Ada, theorized that the soldiers
were probably weak even if they did try to project an image of strength
to the Natives. That's why they had Native enforcers. They didn't want
to risk getting into physical fights with even the women and shatter
the illusion by losing, or not being overwhelmingly dominant. They were
drinking the blood of the Natives, in hopes of building up their
systems. It wasn't going to work--not for them. But the children they
were having with the Natives would probably benefit from the ghoulish
act.<br><br>Steve could hardly be contained, and Damian could only hope
that he didn't rush in and ruin the battle strategy. The soldiers
may--or may not be as strong as they would have been before the breach,
but they still had their skills and they still had weapons.<br><br>The
plan was to take out the Enforcers first with the bow and arrows. Chako
estimated that there were about twenty of them. Then they will send
arrows after the white men, but they figured the soldiers will be into
full combat mode and few arrows will catch them. They will have to
catch them, chase them down before they retreated to their underground
stronghold. The big cat was the essential part of this phase of the
plan and Damian was sure she'll know what to do. He wanted the big cat
to stand between the soldiers and their bunkers. She will buy them
precious moments as well serve as a source of disorientation.<br><br>The first phase of the plan went perfectly. Even Ada was expert with a bow, and they got the Enforcers.<br><br>The Soldiers didn't panic when the arrows started flying. As one, they dropped into a crouch and began an orderly retreat.<br><br>Steve
yelled at the top of his lungs and rushed forward. Damian and the
others followed, all screaming at the top of their lungs like Bruce
instructed. The soldiers turned and started running. Suddenly Sheba was
in front of them snarling and snapping like a vision from hell. <br><br>The Natives scrambled, fleeing like rabbits into the brush.<br><br>Damian
saw Steve run up on one soldier. The man bravely stood up and thrust
his spear out before him. Steve snatched it out of his hand. He grabbed
the wide-eyed man's arm and picked him up high over his head. Then he
threw him, bowling over two other Soldiers who had turned, preferring
to face down 11 screaming people rather than a snarling Tiger.<br><br>Chako ran up and speared both white men to death.<br><br>A
tall, stocky soldier swung at Damian with a machete. Damian ducked and
punched him in the face. The man crumbled like an Egyptian mummy. One
punched killed him deader than a Pharaoh.<br><br>He looked around for
Chandra just to see how she was doing. He wasn't worried because he
knew she could use the spear and if she was in trouble he'd know it
from their psychic connection.<br><br>He saw a leering Soldier lunge at
her and watched with pride as she sidestepped and got behind him. She
kicked him in the back of the knees and he fell down on the ground face
first. She brought her spear down into his back with all her might.<br><br>There were four dying men lying on the ground in Bruce's wake and he hadn't even broken a sweat.<br><br>Chako was using his knife, getting up close and personal. <br><br>Damian
saw Jane chasing one soldier down. Her eyes were wild and her hands
were already bloody. She was taller than the man and she had already
speared him in the gut. He fell on the ground and did a leg maneuver,
causing Jane to fall down hard. He plunged at her with his knife and
she rolled, scrambling to her feet in the same motion. Then she kicked
him in the face as hard as she could. She picked up her spear and
walked over to him but he was already dead.<br><br>Like Damian thought,
the Soldiers were shells of what they were before the breach. Their
four year stay underground and the changed earth had weakened them
probably more than even they knew.<br><br>He watched Michelle, and like
Steve, she was without a weapon, but she was merely practicing with her
opponents. They had no wind and no real strength. She was easily
breaking legs and arms before she broke their necks.<br><br>Nobody got by the big cat. She would swiftly chase down any man who tried to, and maul them.<br><br>Damian
told Ada, Feifong and Sheree that they didn't have to fight unless they
were needed. All three stood on the sidelines watching.<br><br>Elizabeth
was with one particular soldier. He was not as pale as the others. In
fact, even though he was white-skinned, he had the facial features of a
Negro. Damian knew he probably was blacker than midnight four years
ago. He seemed stronger than the other soldiers but it was easy to see
it was Elizabeth herself who was dragging the fight out, not the
Soldier. Finally she jumped up and scissor kicked him in the&nbsp;
throat. He fell to his knees, choking. She took her knife from her band
and cut him a new passageway--from ear to ear.<br><br><font color="#ff8080">" He hurt me,"<font color="#000000"> she said, as if someone was asking for an explanation.<font color="#ff8080"><br><font color="#000000"><br>They
killed half of the soldiers. The other half surrendered--at least
that's what Patrick called it. He and Steve were arguing like they were
going to kill each other. Steve wasn't ready to quit.<br><br>Damian
counted about twenty white men, with Negro facial features. Half of
them were dead but along with the ten live ones, were about twenty
paler white men with Caucasian facial features. Some of the Native
Enforcers were also still alive.<br><br>They were huddled together in the middle of the compound with their heads bowed.<br><br>The big cat was still snarling and growling and when one of them so much as lifted a finger, she lunged.<br><br>Jane, Sheree, Elizabeth, Chandra, Chako, Bruce, and Ada stood over them with spears.<br><br>For
the first time Damian noticed the woman, Chako said had been bound and
beheaded. She was hanging naked upside down, her head was missing and
her flesh was almost transparent. He could see almost every vein in her
body.<br><br>Damian walked over and cut her down.<br><br>Steve swore loudly.<br><br><font color="#408080">" Get the fuck out of the way Patrick."<br><font color="#000000"><br><font color="#808000">"They're unarmed and surrendered Steve."<br><font color="#000000"><br><font color="#408080">"
Then arm them if you want to, and tell them to fight because this is
not going to be over until every one of them is as dead as that young
girl over there."<br><font color="#000000"><br><font color="#808000">" I can't let you do that."<br><font color="#000000"><br><font color="#408080">" You listen to me--"<br><font color="#000000"><br>Steve's eyes narrowed, his tone was low, like an undercurrent of hot lava.<br><br><font color="#408080">"As
far as I'm concerned there are only two kinds of people left in the
world, Predators who can somehow twist their animal, degenerate minds
into believing they can walk the face of this earth raping, robbing and
lording it over other people with impunity-- and the rest of us. I
could never do anything about it in the old world, but in this
world--right here and now-- <i>I'm</i> goddamn king of the jungle. And
I have zero tolerance for two legged Predators, or any body's who's so
greedy, selfish, or ethnocentric that they can't recognize two-legged
Predators. Get the fuck out of my way."<br><font color="#000000"><br>Patrick
stood his ground. Steve reached out quicker than a rattler strike and
grabbed him by the neck, lifted him off the ground.<br><br><font color="#800000">" Put him down Steve."<font color="#000000"> Bruce warned. He shifted his stance.<font color="#800000"><br><font color="#000000"><br>Damian shifted in his own stance. <br><br>Chako put a hand on Bruce's shoulder. <font color="#004000">" Relax, he's not going to hurt him. Damian...,"</font><font color="#000000"> Chako called out,</font><font color="#004000">" you decide. You're our leader. What do we do with them?"</font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Damian
looked over at the huddled, beaten British soldiers. His eyes then ran
over the headless woman. The Natives were streaming back into the
compound. He saw faces that were so battered he wondered how they
survived their beating. He looked at the women; most of them were naked
from the waist up. Nearly all of them had stripes on their backs. He
looked over at the Mistresses and their children. Some were sobbing,
most weren't. He took in the little mixed infants--the next generation
of what Lee called Drakes. In his mind he saw a future, and in his
memory a snippet of the past. <br><br><i>"You're chickenshit Lee, that's why in the end you always lose."<br><br></i>He recalled what Mike said happened to Lee and his people.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Steve knows what to do."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#808000">"Damian...no...show some mercy!"</font><font color="#000000"> Patrick begged.</font><font color="#808000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"I am showing mercy, but to those who deserve it."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Steve glared at the pale men.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"You want weapons?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Most of the men nodded.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">" Shelly, get them their spears."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Jane,
Ada and Elizabeth helped Michelle gather up the men some weapons. They
threw them to the Soldiers. Most of the Soldiers grabbed the spears and
stood up.<br><br>Chako and Bruce joined Jane, Elizabeth, Michelle and Steve.<br><br></font><font color="#808000">"Janie, don't be a part of this. It's murder. Bruce...Chako."</font><font color="#000000"> Patrick's eyes were feverish. </font><font color="#808000">"You know Colonel Robertson, would never allow this."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Bruce said: </font><font color="#800000">"You
know Midnite, the thing that gets me about all this begging for mercy
is that you know that we are going to be pushing on. And there isn't
enough room on our boat for a fraction of these people. You've seen
what they did to that girl over there. </font><font color="#000000">Bruce nodded to the headless woman. </font><font color="#800000">You
heard what Elizabeth said was done to all the young men of this island,
and how women were raped and tortured. These people were in slavery
when we came here and what I want to know is how come they can't get
some of that justice and mercy you're wanting for this scum?</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#800000">You really want us to leave 30 of these bastards alive on this Island with these women and children?"<br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#808000">"
They can't fight, Bruce. The Natives has seen how weak they are. All we
have to do is kill all the Native Enforcers and the people can handle
these men."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Chako's eyes clouded over and a knowing look came over his face.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">" You finish wasting your breath, yet?"</font><font color="#000000"> Steve said to Bruce.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>All
the others had just learned about Patrick everything they needed to
know, but Patrick and Bruce had been best friends for a long time. He
thought he knew the man. He couldn't close the book&nbsp; on ten years
of friendship, yet. He wanted clarification. Maybe Patrick, misspoke. <br><br></font><font color="#804040">" So you don't mind killing all the Native slave drivers, but it's murder to kill the white ones?" </font><font color="#000000">Bruce spat in Patrick's direction, then turned and started walking back towards the camp</font><font color="#804040">.<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve, Chako, Michelle, Elizabeth, and Jane started moving in on the soldiers.<br></font><font color="#804040"><br>"</font><font color="#800080">Wait a minute."</font><font color="#804040"> </font><font color="#000000">Damian said.</font><font color="#804040"> </font><font color="#800080">" I have a better idea."</font><font color="#804040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div>
