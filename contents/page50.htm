I counted about fifty of them. Set up in some kind of compound. White
men...walked and talked like Commandos, probably Special Forces. From
their accents, British. There were Natives to the Island, some of them
roped around their wrists and ankles. About a dozen of them--of the
Natives--seemed to be some kind of Enforcers, judging by the way they
pushed around, and barked at all the others. Most of the Islanders were
women, about two hundred of them. I saw about twenty children, a few
old men, a couple of middle-aged men. Except for the ones cracking the
whips, I didn't see any young Native men...or any white women."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian fell out of his crouch, unto his ass, stunned. <br><br></font><font color="#800080">" What the fuck is going on?"</font><font color="#000000">
He rarely used profanity. Felt like Ma heard him every time he
did--even when she was alive and in another State, or he was on the
playground playing somewhere when he was little. Ma and that old wide,
brown belt, just waiting for him to get home. </font><font style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);" size="4"></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040">" They were probably chosen to survive just like we were.

of the so-called free world&nbsp; worked hand in glove with some
factions of our forces--did a lot of the dirty work against our own
citizens, that we didn't want to risk doing. Our unit hunted some of
them down for some of the crimes they committed against Americans. "<br>
<br style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">
<span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">"So...you're saying there could be cells like that, all over the world?" <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Damian half-stated, half-questioned.</span></span><br style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><br></font><font color="#004000">" There's seems to be a planned agenda unfolding before us, Damian." </font><font color="#000000">Chako said.</font><font color="#004000">
"We knew about it but we didn't think they had the time to distribute
the balm, or to equip all the cells well enough for them to ride out
the breach underground. That still may be the case, but...we had hoped
for the best case scenario--that the extent of their plans began and
ended in the U.S. with the Drakes unit. Looks like we may have gotten
the worse case scenario. Their plans might have been fully implemented,
which </font><font size="4"><font color="#004000">means, </font></font><font color="#004000">as you suggest, they are set up, and fully operational all over the world.<br>
Since they are operational in such a small theater as these Islands,
that suggests that more likely, than not, they are set up to take over
the whole world for slavery like it used to be back in Atlantis, before
the great rebel, broke up the world wide Draconian Empire."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">It
no longer surprised Damian, how deep the Military, Scientific world,
Spy, Space agencies, and other such esteemed, supposedly "rational"
institutions were into the whole, occult, hidden history thing.<br><br>Unless
they wrote in the bible, most people believed the ancient Historians,
Priests and other recorders of events of the past to be fools,
fantasists, liars or stupid children who were so much less
knowledgeable, serious and reliable than today's historians and learned
scribes are. But the people who really ran the world--who had all the
artifacts, documents, evidence and information--took what the Ancients
recorded and reported, <i>very </i>seriously. They had run the world and coursed the future by it.<br><br>What
did continually surprise him, was how openly and casually these occult
soldiers, starting with Lee, were saying such things to him.
Intellectually, he knew they were doing it because they figured secrets
really didn't matter too much considering the condition of the world.
But it still always shocked a little to hear how much truth was kept
from people and how different the world really was from the way most
people lived and died, believing it to be. People had stopped believing
in magic, the fantastical and the supernatural, not knowing that their
way of belief is what was truly lie and illusion--not the magical, and
sometime super advanced world the Ancients believed in and wrote about.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"This is ridiculous."</font><font color="#000000"> Steve got up.</font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040">" Where the hell are you going?" </font><font color="#000000">Bruce grabbed the big man's spear. Steve yanked it loose.</font><font color="#800040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080">" I'm going to kill some fucking devils."<br><br></font><font color="#004000">" Oh, did I forget to mention," </font><font color="#000000">Chako said quickly, </font><font color="#004000">" all&nbsp; of them were armed with some kind of wicked weapon."<br><br></font><font color="#800800">"Steve," </font><font color="#000000">Damian said evenly</font><font color="#008080">,
"we have to plan how we are going to do this. We can't just rush in on
that many highly trained killers. We need to get Patrick, and sat down
and figure out some kind of strategy...but I promise you big guy. We
won't leave these Islands, before we liberate those people."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve
turned and started walking back to their camp. The big cat walked
beside him, looking as solemn and stiff in her stride as Steve did in
his.<br><br>When he arrived back in the camp, Damian immediately put
everyone to the task of disassembling the camp and packing up. They
were leaving the Island for one farther away. There, they will plan,
train, and prepare to come back and liberate those women and children.
He would have liked to do it yesterday, but he knew that simply wasn't
possible. He had four professional soldiers with him--Bruce, Patrick,
Michelle and Chako. Good as they were, they were no match for fifty men
who were just as highly trained. The big cat will be a huge asset in a
battle, and he had no doubts that she understood what was going on as
silly as that would make him sound if he ever told that to anyone. He
had to put Chandra, Sheree, Feifong, Steve, Jane, Ada, himself, and the
new girl, through an extensive, intense combat training course. He knew
Bruce and Chako could do the job. It might take them months, maybe even
a year, but they'll be back, and these people will be set free on their
Island. <br><br>They still had to get to the Southern Continent on
schedule but he was sure they could spare at least a year. They had
crossed the U.S, much faster than they calculated they would. Plus they
where making good time at sea. They had figured in two or three months
stays on land, all along their trip to Africa. After they liberate
those people, they will have to now, abandon that part of the plan and
make shorter stopovers.<br><br>Once they settle in Africa, he knew what his life's mission was to be. He will sail around the world.<br><br>In the story the Ancients tell, the great Rebel went all over the world liberating the enslaved. <br>
<br>
He felt like the great Rebel's spirit was still alive--inside him. And still obsessed with the same purpose.<br><br><i>Who's that muse that everyone seems to think is sitting on your shoulder Damian?<br><br>You've been touched.<br><br>I know. By the very breeze of heaven.<br><br>No I mean by god.<br><br>I see the man. The man who never falls apart. The one who is destined to win.<br><br>Just remember Damian. Even the better man can't win if he doesn't know he's in a contest.<br><br>It's the struggle, Damian. Always had been always will be.<br><br>The way the author depicts him in the book reminds me a lot of you<br><br></i>The
ship was back at sea. Damian was back in his favorite spot at the bow,
staring across the water. The big cat stood beside him, lost just as
deep in her own thoughts. Chandra stood in the cabin doorway silently
watching him. Tears were streaming from her eyes.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></div></div><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden">
