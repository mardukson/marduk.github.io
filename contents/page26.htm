</font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">They
found the pattern. He had been searching for that pattern for 30
years--since his days as an understudy of Douglass McCloud. He already
knew that it was too late to do anything to stop the breaches. He came
to the United States in hopes of helping McCloud and young Damian
perfect their organic solution. Now even that has been rendered a
fruitless quest in light of the pattern discovery. He sure wished that
they hadn't found that pattern. He was getting to be an old man. He
might have been lucky enough to die in his delusions, of one day
finding a solution to the calamity that awaited WoMankind. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">His
reunion with McCloud was easier than he thought it would be. They had
both welled up like women. McCloud cried because he was old and losing
control of his emotions. He got emotional because he saw Jubatta's eyes
in McCloud's head...just before Jubatta went to sleep for the last
time. </font></font></p><p>

</p><p><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
still hadn't decided if he was going to join Damian in his quest to try
to preserve a remnant of WoMankind, or go back home and just lay down
and wait for the end. He never knew how tired and stressed he was until
he landed in "America's" gravity. Maybe he was too old for a new
Genesis or even a fighting chance. Maybe he didn't want to survive
WoMankind's collective demise.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></p></div>
