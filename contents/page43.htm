the dogs, they had an encounter with a Tiger, a bear, and more dogs.
Even a house cat attacked one time, leaping out at Jane and scratching
her face. Patrick killed it. Jane stayed mad at him for 3 days.<br><br>The
animals were everywhere. Damian figured they had all migrated here and
came up against the waters, and couldn't go any farther.<br><br>Damian
and the others had reached the harbor. As expected, there were plenty
of abandoned sailing vessels. The plan was to spend six months here
honing their sailing skills before they attempted to cross the ocean.
They took a boat out everyday. <br><br>They started making and
carrying spears and knives after the tiger attack--if it really could
or should be called that. The big cat looked half starved even with the
great concentration of prey around. When she stalked towards the
Iowees, the cat didn't seem to know how to attack. Damian could tell by
the cautious way she moved forward that if not for starvation, she
wouldn't have approached any of them at all. The Iowees were screeching
like sirens and the cat kept looking behind to ensure her path to
escape was unencumbered. Damian watched calmly from his hut as Chako,
and Michelle approached the animal. He saw the tall woman calming Chako
down, and everyone else was relaxed by watching her demeanor. <br><br>The
big cat started backing up, but was still unwilling to run yet.
Michelle was cooing to the tiger while Chako stayed beside her. Steve stood
back and watched, but he was alert, as was Bruce and Patrick. Finally
Michelle took one step too close and the big cat turned and fled.<br><br><font color="#008080">Wasn't exactly Cudjoe was it?"</font><font color="#000000"> Steve said.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"</span></font><font style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);" color="#ff80ff">It was tame.</font><font color="#000000">" Michelle answered.<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#004000">Think it'll be back</font><font color="#000000">?"

Too many wild animals around.</font><font color="#000000">" Damian said. "</font><font color="#800080">At least not without some kind of protection,</font><font color="#000000">" he added quickly, sensing Chandra's ire. <br><br>"</font><font color="#008080">By gide, then thit settles it</font><font color="#000000">." Steve said, sounding like a mush mouth Englishman. "</font><font color="#008080">Wee feed the cot, and wee make wippons to keel all the bod enemas. Ah wee ah-greed theen</font><font color="#000000">?"<br><br>The grouped laughed. Michelle looked up at him with her eyes beaming adoration.<br><br>"</font><font color="#004000">Alright, we feed the cat.</font><font color="#000000">" Chako shook his head, still chuckling and put an arm around Ada.<br><br><br>**************<br><br>They
named the cat, which was female, Sheba. She was obviously once
someone's beloved pet, not only that, but spoiled almost beyond
toleration...and deeply in love with people. <br><br>It was now
unclear if, even despite her obvious hunger, she wanted to eat the
Iowees or play with them--like she does now. From sunrise to sunset she
shadows the Iowees and Damian figured it might be because she once
belonged to people with small children. <br><br>The cat took swiftly
to Chandra too. The only time she would leave the Iowees, was to follow
Chandra when she went on her forays to find useful vegetation.<br><br>Both
Chandra and Jane carried spears&nbsp; but Damian had a lot more peace
of mind knowing Sheba was with Chandra than the spears. Chandra had
long ago discouraged him of the idea that he or some other man should
shadow her when she went out. She never minded company but she didn't
want a keeper.<br><br>Most of the animals avoided them if they could.
The biggest danger was the hungry dogs who ran in packs but even they
weren't much of a threat now that they all were carrying spears. When
one them was in trouble with the dogs, it only took minutes before they
had help. The women could hold&nbsp; the dogs off with the spears as
well as the men.<br><br>Damian felt they were now ready to pit their
maritime skills against the ocean. The vessel they chose to sail in was
a mid-size schooner with three collapsible masts. They had practiced a
lot in the ship and it was sturdy and easy to maneuver. In this part of
the world the waters and winds were always calm, so they knew there
success handling the boat was not a true marker of their abilities .
They had no real idea what kind of conditions they will encounter the
farther they got from the coast.<br><br>As was their habit before they
went to their separate spots for sleep, the group sat in discussion.
There was a lot more verbal communication because the soldiers still
hadn't developed the ability to read thoughts. Damian was at loss as to
why. Not even Steve had anything to put forward to explain it.<br><br>Chako had taken to sailing, like a fish to water. He was good at it and like anything you are good at, he loved it.<br><br>" </font><font color="#004000">I think we just might make it across that ocean, after all</font><font color="#000000">." He said wistfully, wishing now that he had done more to assuage Alonzo and Tiararay's fears rather than encourage them.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Well,
it's not going to be as easy as just sailing up and down, close to the
shore, but we are prepared. It's been done routinely before. I see no
reason why we can't do it, and if conditions are as calm all over world
as they are here, all we'll really need is stamina and a sense of
direction. We should be fine, but the first rule of any endeavor is to
not be too overconfident."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#800000">Overconfidence is not a problem with me, Damian." </font><font color="#000000">Bruce said. "</font><font color="#800000">I have to tell you, I'm nervous as hell about this." </font><font color="#000000">Feifong squeezed her lover's hand.<br><br>The big cat sat between Chandra and the Iowees like she was people too.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"What about her?" </font><font color="#000000">Steve asked. Aren't cats supposed to hate water?"</font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#8080ff">"That's not cat."</font><font color="#000000"> Feifong said. </font><font color="#8080ff">"That's people."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">The Iowees laughed with delight.<br><br>"</font><font color="#800080">You haven't seen her on the boat yet, Steve?</font><font color="#000000">" Damian laughed.<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Yeah, but I thought the cat was Chako because it looked from here like she was steering."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chako threw a playful air punch in Steve's direction.<br><br>"</font><font color="#808000">What about supplies?</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#808000">The greens don't keep too long and we have a lot of water to cross."</font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Steve answered Patrick. "</font><font color="#008080">We have a map, listing every Island and land mass between here and the South Atlantic. We should be fine on that score."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#800040">You think we'll ever start eating meat again?</font><font color="#000000">" Bruce asked.<br><br>"</font><font color="#008080">You ate meat?</font><font color="#000000">" Steve said, then adding, "</font><font color="#008080">Only if you change your name to Abel and start speaking in tongues.</font><font color="#000000">"<br><br>"</font><font color="#800040">And who are you supposed to be, Steve</font><font color="#000000">?" Bruce retorted--"</font><font color="#800040">Cain</font><font color="#000000">?"<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"He
was a vegetarian, wasn't he? Right now, we're all Cain. Let's just try
not to start speaking in tongues, alright? So we don't start gutting
big cats, small sheep and each other.</font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Sheba yawned widely.<br><br>"</font><font color="#000000">What's Sheba going to eat?</font><font color="#000000">"
Firstshe piped in her tiny little voice, surprising everyone so much
that they openly stared at her. She visibly shrunk within herself.<br><br>Everybody
started babbling at once to answer her. The gist of it was that they
will pack some meat in one of the steel containers on board and drag it
along in the water behind the boat.<br><br>" </font><font color="#008080">Wonder if god will get too mad if we turn the cat into a vegetarian</font><font color="#000000">." Steve said.<br><br>" </font><font color="#000000">She can't live on veggies.</font><font color="#000000"> " Firsthe giggled, seemingly emboldened to speak by his companion's bold leap into the waters.<br><br>" </font><font color="#008080">Why not?</font><font color="#000000">" Unlike the others, Steve talked to the little Beings in the same tone he used normally. "</font><font color="#008080">If Elephants, Giraffes and Gorillas can be vegetarians, why can't other large animals."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#800080">It's something we can try later.</font><font color="#000000">" Damian said thoughtfully. </font><font color="#800080">"But we'll feed her what's she's used to until we're settled in Africa."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br><br><br></font><font color="#000000">"</font><font color="#ff8000"> You don't believe in god, do you Steve?"</font><font color="#000000">
Jane asked bluntly. He and Jane didn't talk much to each other since
the night they made love, but they had developed a good relationship
that didn't require conversation, courtesy or even acknowledgment of
each other.<br><br>"</font><font color="#008080">I'm a Scientist.</font><font color="#000000">"<br><br>"</font><font color="#ff8000">You didn't answer my question.</font><font color="#000000">"<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Yes I did. What about you, do you believe in god?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"Of course."<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Then
explain something to me Janie, because all my life I've been puzzled by
this. Your people are first generation, white South Africans, right? I
want to know how people can believe so much in a god who is supposed to
be good, just, and vengeful-- and at the same time commit so much evil.
Do you believe in the hell thing or not?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She
didn't answer. Damian and Ada, both knew Steve. Has known him for a
long time. Damian smiled tightly, knowing a diatribe was brewing. Ada
leaned forward. Steve launched:</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#008080">"You remember how miserable it
was outside during the heat waves before the big breach? Can you image
living inside of a real fire forever and being unable to die? Your
people claim to believe in eternal damnation, yet you have lived like
gods for two centuries among people you have robbed, slaughtered and
tortured by the millions.</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br>I
don't care whether your Ancestors considered them "real people" or not,
they were still living, thinking Beings--just like the Iowees, yet
every sin, inside and outside the book, was committed against them
without respite for three hundred years.&nbsp; And you want to come off
on some superior tip to <i>me</i> about believing in god? No, I don't
believe in god because god is what incurious people like you believe
in. I believe in whatever created all the beauty and goodness in the
world, and whatever that is, cant be this thing that people have been
calling god while murdering, enslaving and stealing.<br><br>And that's
because, I have never in my life treated anybody with one ounce less
consideration than I would have wanted for myself and my love ones,
despite what anybody or anything says. I come from a line of mostly
dirt poor people, who keeps themselves separate from the world...
people who had always lived like they thought they were being watched
and judged--not in pretensions and their bellies. Seems to me, I'm not
the one who doesn't believe in god."<br><br></font><font color="#ff8000">"You're not being fair, Steve." </font><font color="#000000">Tears were in her voice and eyes.</font><font color="#ff8000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080">" Am I being truthful?"<br></font></font><font size="4"><font color="#000000">.</font></font><br>
<font size="4"><font color="#ff8000">"I've never hurt anyone and neither have my parents."<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Did
you or your parents ever atone;apologized for what your grandparents
did? It's not like it wasn't documented, or was ancient history.<br>I'm
a Scientist Janie, and I know what the Aids epidemic in the Southern
part of Africa was. It was a vengeful act of biological sabotage
against entire groups of people. Or do you think it was a coincidence
that Southern Africa was the stronghold of Western domination of
Africa? A stronghold that was steadily being dismantled by liberation
wars.<br><br>
Thousands of white Missionaries and so called world health organization
workers knew the time frame of the start of the Aids epidemic. They may
have been unknowingly used, but they had brains, and they had to have
at least asked themselves questions. But did you ever hear of any of
them atoning in public by simply raising the question? Any white, South
African?<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#008080">Can people, who do, benefit from, or remain silent of such atrocities, really believe in hell, Janie...or God?<br></font></font></p>
