<div align="left"><font size="6"><br><font size="4">How amazingly fast,
they were already beginning to adapt to it all; the corpses, the
silence, the fear, the weather, the thinner air that they breathed, the
purely leafy nourishment that they survived on. They were now in what
used to be the thriving state of Maryland. Nearly three years have
passed. Within that time, they have morphed into entirely different
creatures--at least it seemed that way to him at times. They haven't
grown any extra eyes or limbs but in so many other ways they were as
different from what they were three years ago as night is from day. <br><br>To
describe them most accurately, is simply to say they have become
primitive, yet at the same time mentally, and psychologically advanced,
so as to be almost a different species.<br><br>In the daytime they wore
nothing but wraps around their private sections like the pictures in
the nature magazines and the old documentaries. Except for Chandra,
they all walked the earth topless, whenever the terrain and weather
conditions allowed. There was no longer any fear of cancer or other
heat related maladies because Zeus had finished with this part of the
world, and the sun was back to being life's best friend.<br><br>The
weather is neither as extreme, or variant as it used to be before the
breach that destroyed the people of the world. It is hot in the day, a
humid heat, that they had long gotten accustomed to; at night it is
cold, but they have gotten used to that as well. <br>The coldest is
always the same 33 degrees. In some measure the environmental condition
of this part of the world seem to be on a course to great
improvement--a foreseeable, sort of paradise. The vegetation is
thriving, the water as clear as glass, the air sweet like candy. They
could easily rebuild here, but the pattern showed that in about five
years from date, a bolt will hit in the Southern Hemisphere, setting
off a new chain reaction that will reach it's fullest manifestation in
this part of the world again. The hope is by the time they reach
Africa; things will be improving the same way they are here. The
pattern shows that there will then be a indeterminable length of
respite from the breaches.<br><br>The sun is pacified but not the same.
Not as high, or as bright, it seems. Every new day is like the day
before;the same temperature, the same breeze, the same sunset and
sunrise.<br>It doesn't snow, and there is rarely any force of wind stronger than a gentle breeze. <br><br>They
had yet to meet any living flesh, as they had projected in their
thesis--not even a single hare. It was a puzzle that could not be
explained. There should be other life, especially animal life--unless,
like they--the rest of the living are moving South, instinctively
knowing, that survival lies to the South.<br><br>They will have to
cross the wide waters in a couple of years. There will be plenty of
abandoned boats, ships, vessels of all kinds to chose from once they
reach the harbor, but there will be no engines or propellers to ease
them across the ocean. They will have to sail under man and woman
power. This, they also had projected. Steve, Mike, Ada, himself, were
all experienced sailors. They had prepared for it. The waters will be
calm. There is no longer any agitation in this part of the world, not
in men or in nature.<br><br>It's true. They do not fight. There are not
even arguments. There are still lusts, jealousies, resentments, rivalry
and ambitions, and they are transmitted and felt, stronger and clearer
than ever, but strangely there is never a conflict. In fact, there is
rarely a conversation, except when a group decision has to be made. He
was sure the others talked to one another in privacy but among the
group, there is no informal discussion. There is rarely a need for it.
Every man and woman does their job to ensure the survival of themselves
and the group. The communication between them is like that of the deaf,
dumb and blind. They sense and feel one another like some kind of new
species of dolphins.<br><br>There will probably be no verbal
communication at all among their descendants, if they ever have any.
Their senses were heightening, evolving at an astonishing rate. Maybe
because there was now so much quiet and solitude in the world. Maybe
that's why there are no conflicts. Everybody's thoughts and intentions
were becoming an open book.<br><br>Yes, he now knew he was in a
contest. Of course he had always known it, but now he could not help
sometimes bursting into laughter at the naked yearning and resentments
of the dark-haired man who has for so long been such a big part of his
life. Mike was his family; had been even before the journey. He could
only look at him as he would a jealous little brother, whose ass you
might have to kick sometimes to keep him out of your stuff.<br><br>Steve,
on the other hand wasn't laughing at all. He didn't like what Mike was
emitting in regards to his "boss." Everybody can feel the tension. It
is like a dark cloud hovering over them all. Maybe it was another
reason they didn't argue. Death was lingering to close to the surface
for anyone to lose control of their emotions.<br><br>And Chandra...did
she read, or sense Jane's thoughts towards him, or Feifong's, or
Sheree's? Did Mike read Feifong's emissions toward him? Did that add to
his enmity? And Janet...how did she feel knowing how much Sheree loved
him? Did she--they-- sense it all, or was it just his own senses that
were so heightened to the emissions that had only to do with him? <br><br>Like
himself and Steve, Jane no longer wore, or needed glasses, her once
soft, marshmallow-like body was now as tight as a drum; bronzed, and
more eye-catching than even Ada's stunning figure. With her new beauty
came a different attitude. She knew how much she was desired and it was
a strange situation to her. It frightened as well as bolstered
her.&nbsp; She was now like an island. Not haughtily aloof, or
emotionally shut off from the group, but possessed of a
self-sufficiency that left them all with little doubt that she could go
off by herself at anytime and still survive.<br><br>She was also a
source of tension between Ada and Steve. The big man could not hide his
desire for her from the group, much less the woman who loved him.<br><br>Everyone
could see how Mike wanted her too. But he didn't try to hide it, and
his lustful thoughts carried no feelings of guilt beside them. He acted
like he cared nothing about Feifong's feelings, but Damian couldn't
really recall a time when he did.<br><br>He did remember when Jane
wasn't so much of a rock, when she leaned on Chandra like a crutch. The
two of them had grown very close during those days. Closer than twin
sisters. <br><br>That's why he knew that what drove her to unclothe
herself in front of him had to be something stronger than lust, or
loneliness, or even misguided notions of being in love. And he had a
pretty good idea what it was.<br><br>She had come uninvited into his
and Chandra's hut. It was late in the day, almost dark, and an unusual
time for it, but Chandra was away searching for, and gathering new
additions to add to her collection of herbs and medicine. Damian was
alone.<br><br>Her naked breasts were no longer any source of curiosity
for him, but he had never before seen that which lied covered between
her legs. She took one step inside he and Chandra's space and dropped
the veil around her modesty. He didn't react, in any measured way,
because he knew something had to give; that sooner or later it had to
be faced. Chandra knew. They all knew, but he hadn't figured out what
to do about it, and he had let it fester, even though the torment he
saw in her eyes at that moment, was an anguish, he knew she had been
living with for a long time.<br><br>She loved Chandra, and there was
still enough of the old left in them all, to feel shame and anguish
over betraying the ones they loved. She was lonely, but more than that,
he thought she was a victim of her father's fear of death.<br><br>He
had harbored the hope that they would have met some other survivors
long before now. Found a companion for her. There had to be some
healthy people left in the world.<br>
<br><font color="#ff8040">" I can be like a second wife to you," </font><font color="#000000">she said, speaking her father's words. <br>
<br>
</font><font color="#000000">He wracked his brain trying to think of
what to say, to do, as if a solution would come to him at that moment
that he hadn't been able to find in over two years. How long she has
lived with this ache inside her? How desperate she must be, to expose
herself this way when surely she knew what his response would be? They
could all read one another on a higher level now. What did she hope to
accomplish, <i>now</i>?<br>She had avoided even speaking to him much
before. Now, suddenly she is standing before him as naked as the day
she was born, not only willing to risk betraying Chandra, but willing
to even risk being caught by her--in her own space.<br><br>Was the
solution for her to go to Mike, Steve? Ada was once what would be
called sexually liberated. Could she ever share Steve with Jane? <br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">" I'm not here because I'm lonely," </font><font color="#000000">she read his thoughts. </font><font color="#ff8040">"and I don't want Mike or Steve. "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
finally reached down, picked up her skirt and handed it to her. The
temperature was starting to fall. He watched with a disturbing twinge
of disappointment as she passively covered herself back up.<br><br><i>What did you think, Damian? She was going to refuse to cover up, and launch herself at you...like her old man did?<br><br></i>She
shivered and hugged herself around her naked breasts. He went over to
where Chandra kept her clothes, and picked out one of her night time
tops. He handed it to Jane.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I think what you want--all you can allow yourself to want --is what your daddy implanted in you." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">He decided to be brutally honest. </font><font color="#800080">"You
know, he just wanted you to be with who he thought was going to come on
top in a new world. He wanted you to save his existence through your
womb."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000">As she pondered his words, he added:<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Someone other than me can do that. I'm in love with Chandie." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Her face flushed red.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"
I am not a scientist like you, or my father. Life is not a bunch of
graphs, analysis, and calculations to me. Do you think I could open
myself up to a man just because my father wanted me too.." </font><font color="#000000">She began to cry</font><font color="#ff8040"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span><br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra
entered inside the hut. She stood for a moment, assessing the
situation. She said nothing, neither did her expression change. She put
the plants she had picked out, with the others in the hut and returned
to sit on the covered ground, beside Damian.<br><br>She reached out both hands to Jane.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Put yuh hands inna mine."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane, whose posture and demeanor were rife with apology, leaned forward and grabbed Chandra's hands.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" Wat di yuh want?<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane's eyes tentatively shifted in Damian's direction.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Stand up." </font><font color="#000000">Like a mindless robot, Jane stood up. Chandra turned to Damian and caressed his right cheek.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Do everyting I sey, okay?" </font><font color="#000000">Damian nodded, his face a mask of confusion.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Chandra turned back to Jane. </font><font color="#0000ff">"Com', sit here between we."</font><font color="#000000">
She patted the space between her and Damian. Damian shifted over and
Jane moved to position herself between him and Chandra. Chandra took
Jane's hands again. <br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat do yuh want?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Really?" </font><font color="#000000">Jane had never been so close to Damian and she was feeling a lightheaded.</font><font color="#ff8040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Chandra nodded.<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"I want Damian to hold me...in his arms."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra patted his right hand. </font><font color="#0000ff">"It's okey."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian put his arms around Jane and felt her melt into him. She audibly gasped. Tears wet his neck.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat di yuh want, now?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"I want...I want...<i>Kiss</i> me Damian?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Gwan bwoy. Gi she wat she want."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Chandie?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She leaned over and caressed his face again. </font><font color="#0000ff">"Trust me."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
did trust her. That wasn't it. He did what she and Jane asked of him.
He kissed Jane and separated himself quickly. She was still leaning
into him.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"There's still sumting yuh want, gal?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane
grabbed Damian's hands and pressed them to her breasts. She kissed him
again, wrapped her arms around his neck, tried to pull him down on top
of her. He resisted, looking over her shoulder at Chandra, shaking his
head.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat di yuh want?<br>Wat di yuh want?<br>Wat di yuh want?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra
was repeating like a mantra, as if she was casting some kind of spell.
Jane was grabbing at him, inside his cloth, like she was on fire. She
had ripped the wrap away from her and was arching her back, thrusting
her pelvis at him. Damian was soft and as small as the day he was born,
confused, embarrassed and growing angry. Then Chandie reached over and
uncovered him, touched him, sent lighting through his veins, his penis
lurched at the same instant that Jane pelvis lunged at him. He touched
her.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat di yuh want?<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Jane heard Chandra, but she could only respond with a moan.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat di yuh want? Sey it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
held back, held out, sensing that Chandra needed a clear answer to her
question for whatever it is she was trying to do. His flesh was
trembling, betraying both he and Chandra, as Jane pressed against him.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat di yuh want?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Damian..<i>I want Damian</i>!" </font><font color="#0000ff">Jane screeched.</font><font color="#ff8040"><br></font><font color="#0000ff"><br>"Why?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Because I love him."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"But he don't love yuh. He loves <i>me.</i>"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She responded with an </font><font color="#ff8040">"Oh," </font><font color="#000000">grabbed behind Damian and tried to pull him inside her.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yuh still want he?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She shook her head wildly.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Are yuh sure?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"yes, oh god <span style="font-style: italic;">yes</span>!"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra nodded to Damian and his penis found Jane's hunger like it had a mind of its own. <br>Inside
her, he felt nothing but shame, anger and hurt--for both he and Jane.
When it was over, it tormented him to think that he may never feel the
same about Chandie, again.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"How di yuh feel?" </font><font color="#000000">She asked Jane.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Empty. Cold. Lonely."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Wat di yuh want?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff8040">"Warmth...I want to be warm."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra picked up the blanket that had been kicked aside. She covered Jane. <br><br>Damian had already gotten up and was sitting over in a corner.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Soon, you will find your heart's warmth." </font><font color="#000000">She whispered to Jane.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Jane smiled sadly. </font><font color="#ff8040">"Really?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff8040"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Soon." Go now."<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jane stood up, dressed and left the hut.</span><br><br></font><font color="#000000">Chandra walked over to Damian and sat beside him. She pressed her breasts against his back, nuzzled his neck.<br><br>Already he was beginning to understand.<br><br>He had once thought that in some ways she was behind and in others more advanced than the wisest of&nbsp; Sages.<br>He
now knew that she was behind nothing, but him at that moment and that
was only because she wanted to be. He turned to her, met her waiting
lips with his own. <br><br>He lied to himself so hard he was really
convinced. But Jane had come to him naked for the first time in over
two years of believing that she wanted him, and only him, for a reason.
And that was because she was sensing, since she lost weight and had
changed to be such a beautiful butterfly, that for the first time, he
desired her also. <br><br>He may not have cheated on Chandie
physically that night and maybe not even the next time the opportunity
presented itself, but he had let Jane sit there in front of him naked
for a full 5 minutes before he handed the skirt to her. He thought that
he was being noble and loyal while he sat there with a beautiful,
lovelorn young woman, talking to her about his undying love for
Chandie. But he knew it was his suppressed desires that brought her
inside their space in the first place.<br><br>He laid Chandra down, she
reached for his need, which started where she grabbed, but ended
everywhere. He wanted all of her. He wanted to give her all of him. He
knew how far he had traveled down that road toward ruining the best
thing in life he will ever know.<br><br>That's why he loved her so long
and tender that night, she--always the earliest bird--- had slept the
next day until almost noon.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></font></div>
