look back Damian. Don't look back. Don't let Chandra look back. Just
keep moving ahead. Forward. That's the only way to go---the only
direction to face.</font></i><font size="4"><br><br>They were five
months into their journey. The last of the vehicles gave out 2 days
ago, somewhere in the State of North Carolina. They had begun their
journey from the southernmost part of Florida. They had only been able
to run the engines of their RVs at about 20 miles an hour--for five or
ten mile intervals, before they overheated and had to be stopped and
allowed to cool. As long as the AC worked, they slept and stayed inside
the RVs as much as possible. The heat wave was cooling down and he knew
that sooner or later they will have to get out of the RVs and get out
in their new world but none of them were any more prepared for it
emotionally, when the last vehicle broke down, than they were when they
started out. The vehicles gave them a form of refuge. <br><br>After
the last of their three RVs broke down they had to abandon travel by
the interstates and highways. The heat bouncing off the concrete and
asphalt was unbearable outside the shelter of the vehicles. Their
synthetic supplies were almost gone because they had to throw so much
of it away. It was time to start getting used to roots and berries. <br><br>They
were on foot now, traveling through the wooded parts of the United
States, as much as possible while maintaining their steady northward
course to New York. <br><br>For the first time, they were seeing it up
close and personal, experiencing it in full color, smelling it, choking
on it, feeling it;crawling, soaking, seeping under the skin, inside the
bones, like marrow.<br><br>Death.<br><br>How simple it is to imagine
it, to talk about it, read about it, watch it for entertainment at the
movies or for an ounce of that euphoric feeling of "lucky me" when you
see it on the news and it's happening to someone else; to another man,
woman, or child, in another city, another Country, another space, but
not yours...not yours.<br><br>The vehicles were a greater source of
refuge than they ever appreciated, or ever could have. They knew it was
out there, under their wheels, in the smoke of their exhaust pipes, in
the whoosh of their tailwind. But keep the windows rolled up, the radio
on, the eyes focused ahead--don't look back, and you can pretend--not
that it's not happening, or that it's not out there---but that you
could escape- untouched, the true essence of it.<br><br>It wasn't
that he hasn't seen death up close before they begin their journey. But
there is death; which every living thing will experience at some point.
Death that is accidental, incidental and natural. Death that is
diabolically purposeful, impartially catastrophic,--all imaginable,
tolerable-- mentally and physically acceptable; survivable. <br>
<br>
Then there is death that extends far beyond the realms of imagination,
thought...death that looms so large and piles up so high that nothing
else can be seen...no light, no end, no hope, no future, no escape.<br><br>Chandra
thought she knew death, had seen its face, shook its hand, developed a
comfortable understanding of it due to her work with her clinic.<br>
<br>Steve, Mike, Ada-- they all thought they were inoculated to the
horrors of death;men and women of science, Adepts with knowledge
and&nbsp; comprehension of the bigger picture, where death, they knew,
or thought, was just an essential part of life--nothing to get in a
state about. <br><br>Lot's wife. Did she also think she knew death?
Understood it? Could handle it? Could withstand the full frontal image
of it in all its power and majesty? <br><br>He almost lost them all
when they lost that last vehicle. None of them wanted to go on;stepping
on the dead corpses of men, women, children and infants every time they
lifted their foot and put it back down. <br><br>Seemed like at the
moment of their impending demise, all the people streamed back into the
woods---back to nature. The highways had bodies lying on them but
nothing like what they discovered in the woods.<br><br>Nobody with him wanted to live on when everybody else was dead. Dead. Dead.<br><br><font color="#ff8040">Jane...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage28.jpg" border="0" height="259" width="256"> <br><font color="#000000">The
young suburbanite-- the jewel of gods and men, the untouched, the
blessed, the protected. What favor had they, she, by shielding her from
the underside of death for so long--death that contributed so heartily
to her privileged existence? <br><br>The only thing to do with her,
besides leaving her free to act on her own determination to kill
herself was to keep her medicated. Chandra kept her sedated with herbs.
The young woman only wakes up to scream. <br><br></font><font color="#8000ff">Feifong...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage29.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="180"> <br></font><font color="#000000">The
worldly alpha woman. What she knew of death may not be what Chandra
knew or even of what he, Steve, Mike, or Ada knew. But she had seen
death. Maybe more than they, maybe more than Chandra.<br>She didn't
want to go on but it wasn't because she couldn't face the horrors of
death, it was because she couldn't go through the horrors of life
again. Life in a world where all the skills she had perfected to
survive, to strive, was as useless as the vehicles they had to abandon.<br><br>She
didn't need to be sedated but it was as if she had regressed 200 years.
She was like an 18th century, Chinese female peasant. The woman who had
looked into his eyes with such confidence when they first met was now
like a well-trained pet; obedient, voiceless, without an ounce of
self-will. <br><br></font><font color="#ff00ff">Sheree...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage30.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="189"> <br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage31.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="200"> <br><font font="" color="#ffff0e">&lt;&gt;<font color="#000000">

and Janet screamed in each other's arms from the moment they entered
the woods, every time a foot landed--until they grew hoarse, voiceless.
Until they found a clear spot, sat down, and refused to get back up.<br>Chandra
gave them a mixture of something. It did not put them to sleep as
quickly as what she gave Jane did to Rhoady's daughter, but it calmed
them and helped them eventually, to find a place of mental tranquility.<br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">Ada...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage32.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="200"> <br></font><font color="#000000">She wanted to die. It was not as if she didn't know what to expect. She just decided that she couldn't live with it.<br><br><br><br></font><font color="#408080">Steve...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage33.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="200"> <br></font><font color="#000000">He loved Ada. More than he loved life--especially in a world where life had been so completely overshadowed by death.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#400080">Mike...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage34.jpg" border="0" height="266" width="235"> <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Maybe
he had plans, aspirations...visions in his mind of a new world with him
reigning supreme over a bunch of happy frolicking brown and black
people. Damian had long known about the egoistic, superiority complex
the guy tried so hard to contain under the controlled condition of laws
and civilization. But in a chaotic new world were Kingship was laid out
there for anyone who was strong enough to take...maybe he thought the
future was his;drew so many vivid colors on the pictures in his mind
that when his big moment came he never conceived of the gray, the
coldness, the stillness, the emptiness...the silence.<br><br>He tried
to shoot himself in the head with a d-14 tech that discharged so
weakly, the bullet stuck in the barrel. Damian and Steve disarmed and
calmed him down enough for Chandie to sedate him. That was the second
day after the last vehicle broke down. After that day, he was back to
his old, swaggering self, only quieter and more aloof.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">Chandra...<br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage35.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="200"> </font><font color="#000000">She
wanted to die too. But only after everyone else was dead. She never
screamed when she stepped on a corpse--not even the first time. When
her shoulders slumped, it was only after Jane went crazy, Sheree and
Janet had sat down with no intentions of getting back up, Ada had
begged Steve to kill her, and Mike had tried to shoot himself in the
head.<br>She told Damian of the plant that could kill them all
painlessly. She would administer a dose of it to everyone and they will
simply fall asleep and never wake up. The dose had to be precise
according to each of their body weight;too much and they would die in
agony from the inability to breathe; too little and they would wake up
and slowly starve too death because the poison paralyzes before it
kills. She told him that she will watch to be sure that no one survives
to suffer, then she will take her own dose. <br><br>As he listened to
her, all he could think about was, who will stay in watch for her--his
sweet, ethereal Chandra? If he ever harbored the fleetest thought of
giving up it was banished for all eternity at that moment.<br><br>Chandra cannot die. What other beauty is left in the world? The stars? The Galaxies? The Universe?<br>What other good? What other light? Not only must she not die. She must not cry.<br><br><i>No woman no cry. No woman no cry.<br><br></i>Bob
Marley sang in his head while the blood of every man who ever died,
fought, or rose above the limits of his abilities for love of a woman
pounded in his heart.<br><br>For the love of Chandra.<br><br>They all
must live. Steve, Ada, Mike, Feifong, Sheree, Janet, Jane...Not only
live, but soar, higher than the gods will allow. Above the open cage
that left them trapped and naked to the whims, vices, piques and
follies of madmen and mad gods.<br><br><br>Night fell. Fortunately,
they all--his valued Charges--found peace in their separate dreams. All
except Chandra, who was standing by the outskirts of their camp looking
out into the night. Bathed in the light of the moon-- contrasted
against the black of the night--she resembled so much a wispy, shadowy,
celestial entity that she had once indignantly declared she was not; he
had to blink twice to see her clearly. He walked softy up behind her,
turned her by the shoulders and took her into his arms.<br><br><i>What authority gave him leave to be so bold...presumptuous? It was the permission granted by love.<br><br></i>But he had never even held her hand before. Yet, she acted neither offended, surprised, nor frightened.<i><br></i><br></font><font color="#800080">"Chandie..."<br><br></font><font color="#000000"><i>Is
that why everyone eventually called her that, because it is her name,
but a softer, gentler, prettier, more delicate version of it--more
suitable to her beauty which shines from inside out but is more radiant
from near, than afar--unlike the rays of the sun?</i><br><i><br></i>Her
sleight frame in his arms, against his flesh, warmed like fire, stirred
like a swirling wind, awakened like the first breath of sun on a wilted
flower.<br><br>"</font><font color="#800080">Please...please. Don't ever speak of dying again."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Why?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Did
she not know? Was she toying with him? Or is it that she have become so
accepting--has seen so much of it, that it held no power over her, no
fear, no mystery--possibly, has even come to seem to her, as a
blessing, an immutable act of kindness when there is so much pain and
mental torment?<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Because I love you
so much, it is like a dagger thrust in my heart to hear it. It gives me
terrible palpitations to think inadvertently of it."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Yuh <i>love</i> me?" </font><font color="#000000">She pulled back from him&nbsp; to get a more expansive view of his face."</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Surely she was not that oblivious to the shameless mendicancy of the starving. For six months he had done nothing towards her <i>but</i>
love her; in the way he looked at her, spoke to her, catered to her,
sent his thoughts, wishes and yearnings on the wings of the gentle
breeze to deliver and deposit onto to the very heart and soul of her.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"You don't feel it?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" I feel sumting, yes."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
might have laughed. He might even have felt embarrassment at the
condition the nearness of her put him in. But he didn't. He didn't know
if she was joking or not. In nearly six months of traveling with her
he'd learned that she was delayed in some things and advanced beyond
the wisdom of Sages in others. And she had a sense of humor that,
though often displaced, dispelled the puerile, innocent look of her.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Do you feel it from afar...when we're not close like this?"<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"I thought it was mi feelings for yuh, bwoy."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She
was only four years older than he, and she looked much younger. After
six months of watching him guide them all through some harrowing times,
she still called him, boy. For some reason it delighted him, thrilled
him in the loins like a jet magazine center-fold used to do. He'll be a
boy to her when they are both bent and gray and that was fine with him.
<br><br>They stood together in silence. Damian had always known when a
female wanted to be kissed or touched. But he couldn't decide how to
broach it with her. How do you rip the petals off a rose? And after you
do, can it ever be a rose again? How much will it change his fresh,
fairy ghost of a woman?<br><br>Jane screamed. Her loud terrified
screech shattered their magical moment like a brick thrown into a
window. Chandra pulled away from him.<br><br>She gave him a look that
might have been most effectively described as apologetic but there was
much more in it than that. Damian's love for her soared to new heights.
What he saw in that look is what every man and woman spends a lifetime
searching for in another's eyes--in and outside of intimate situations.
She was a healer, which may have explained that look more than anything
else but to have someone see you, really see you...what you need, what
you desire, what you're feeling, and sincerely caring about it above
even their own screaming desires, is the end of searching, the end of
wanting, yearning, the end of hunger; the need to discover, experiment,
seek. It is the end and beginning of all at the same time.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Mi got ti gi' Janie she dose before she hurt herself."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian reluctantly released to her, her soft, warm hand.<br><br>He stood there like a teen-aged girl, hugging himself as he watched her walk away.<br><br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Boss."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve called under his breath to Damian, from across the camp site. Damian approached him and saw Ada was asleep in his arms.<br><br>Damian sat down on the ground across from them.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I don't want her to die." </font><font color="#000000">The big man looked over Damian's head, to some place far in the distance.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#408080">"
I don't want her to suffer either. It tears me up inside to see her
crying from the moment she wakes up, until she falls back asleep."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian knew exactly how he felt.<br><br><i>No woman, no cry. No woman, no cry<br><br><br></i></font><font color="#800080">"
Steve, I'm going to need you like no man ever needed another before and
I swear, we--all of us-- are going to make it though this. In a few
weeks we'll be reaching regions that were less populated. We'll get a
respite from all the corpses. What we have to do is hold everybody
together for that long. I know we can do that...you, me, Chandra...Ada
is stronger than this. She's just tired and shocked. Tomorrow she'll be
better--looking at things differently. With her back with us to help
calm people, we'll get through this critical point, just don't--"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve was still looking in the distance.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">--"give up on me big guy."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve lowered his head. He looked Damian in the eyes.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"We're going to make it through this, Damian?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian returned his friend's eye contact.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Together, we will."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Silence fell between them.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Boss..."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian had stood up and was on his way to check on Sheree and Janet.<br><br>He turned.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"I never would have done what she asked and you know why?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian shook his head.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">"Because then I would have had to kill myself and that means I would have let you down...Boss." </font><font color="#000000">The big man's eyes suddenly glistened in the moonlight.</font><font color="#408080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>Damian stood as attentive as an oak tree.<br><br></font><font color="#408080">" I'm <i>never</i> going to let you down."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He lowered his chin on the top of Ada's head and closed his eyes.<br><br>Damian left them to their peace.<br><br>Sheree was sleeping soundly.<i> </i>Janet
lay snoring softly beside her. Both of them were breathing easily
through their masks, so he turned from them. He saw Chandra adjusting
the air purifying mask and pulling up the covers on Feifong, so he
walked over to check on Mike.<br><br>The dark-haired, stocky man was lying on his back; eyes wide open, staring at the three quarter moon.<br>He hadn't been near Feifong, or anyone else since his breakdown. Damian interrupted his thoughts.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"What do you see?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">He
sat down beside Mike, leaned back on his hands. He was sure Mike was
going to be fine. Like Ada, he was tired and&nbsp; traumatized but the
man was a bull.<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"I see the man." </font><font color="#000000">He took so long to respond, Damian was halfway back up to his feet. He nestled back down.</font><font color="#400080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"The man in the moon?" </font><font color="#000000">he joked.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#400080">"No, the better man. The Man who never falls apart. The Man who is destined to win."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Come on Mike. Does this really have to be a contest with you?"<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"Everything
is a contest, Damian. Always have been, always will be. It's just that
some people know they're in one and some don't."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Mike,
we might well be the last nine people alive in the western Hemisphere.
And you're telling me the games have begun already?"<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"They
began four years ago, Damian. That day McCloud brought an 18 year old
snot nose kid into my lab--a Lab I had ruled-- and lived for, for 13
years of my life, and told me he was my boss."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Mike raised his head and made a pillow with his hands.<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"You
know what that said to me, Damian? It told me that you were better than
me, smarter than me, more precious to my father than me. That's what he
was you know--that old man--to all of us. He was our father."<br><br><i></i></font><i><font color="#000000">I liked that white haired, white robed, old white man but he was never my father. Not even metaphorically.<br><br></font></i><font color="#000000">Due
to getting to know Steve, Jenna and Mr. McCloud, he had come a long way
from the days, when like most his peers, he disliked white people on
principle. But he'll never come that far.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I knew Mr. McCloud was wrong. I told him that."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Mike turned his head to Damian.<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"Don't you get it? That's just it. He wasn't wrong. He wasn't wrong then and he isn't wrong now."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian sighed and stood up.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Can't you just let it go?"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Mike went back to staring up at the moon.<br><br></font><font color="#400080">"Just remember one thing, Damian. Even the better man can't win if he doesn't know he's in a contest."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian departed from&nbsp; Mike, and went to his own spot. He lay down on his back and closed his eyes, tried to sleep.<br>Then he heard the leaves crackling beside him, the grass rustling.<br><br>She
leaned over him, unzipped and reached inside his pants, handled him for
a few seconds. Then she straddled him. She had come to him already bare
except for a wrap-around skirt which she raised when she squatted. She
forced herself down on him. He heard pain, escape between her clenched
teeth. Moments later, he felt something shatter between them, the last
barrier that stood between she and him, Damian and Chandra, two minds,
two souls, one heart.<br><br>It could have lasted seconds, it could
have lasted hours;there was no way for him the measure time--
internally or externally--because time had no meaning, no reality when
he held her in his arms, she held him in her magical depth.<br><br>Long
after she was quiet beside him, he lay awake in ecstasy, still on fire
just from the sound of her breathing, the essence of her life lightly
blowing against the skin of his neck. The feel of her heart, where his
hand searchingly cupped her left breast, was beating like an African
drum, in a call and answer rhythm with the pounding of his own heart.<br><br>How
many females has he intimately known in his life? How many orgasms? How
many moments when he thought he had reached the apex of euphoria? But
he had never before even gotten off the ground, much less soared among
the stars. He had never before experienced an inkling of what it felt
like to biblically know Chandra.<br><br>No crueler trick has the gods
ever played on man and woman, than to deny them unto death, their one
and true love, to send to them clones and cheap imitations, shadows,
when somewhere, seeking to find him, to find her, there is the heart
missing from their right breast.<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"You've been touched"<br></font><font color="#000000">This she said after a silence had passed between them that was so long, he thought she had fallen asleep.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"I know. By the very breath of heaven."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">It never failed to amaze him at how quickly she grasped his bad poetry.<br>Any other woman would have looked at him like she hadn't heard him right. She said:<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"No, I mean by god."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">All his life he had been told that in some form;by his Mother, his teachers, Sheree, McCloud, Maguthaba, and even Mike.<br><br>If
it's true, what god had touched him? Even though he highly respected,
and revered the real and potential effect on reality that is the energy
called Jesus, and that Entity's teachings and sayings, he gave no knee
to the image or the places that housed it, neither to the father, son,
or the holy ghost.<br><br>He was a scientist. No Allahs, Buddahs,
Krishnas, or Yahwehs, would touch him for anything, because he would
never touch any of them for anything.<br><br>He hated evil and injustice, so no god of hell would have touched him for any purpose.<br><br>So who is this great muse of his, that everyone seem to think is riding on his shoulders?<br><br>Like
most scientists, and other great thinkers, if he had to choose one
mythical character who could be considered a god, that he would revere
enough to adore, it would be the one who was said to have put his
greatest value on progress, unity, peace and the advancement of all,
equally.<br><br>Was it that god, who was riding on his shoulders?<br><br>He
knew there was a wide perception by most, of mysticism and occult
activities surrounding the kind of people that choose the path in life
that Chandra has chosen. Visions, foresight, spells, predictions, and
all that kind of thing. But he wasn't about to get into that with
her--especially tonight.<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"Go to sleep, baby. You have been carrying the weight of six people and I know you have to be at least as tired as they are."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">"Good ni, bwoy." </font><font color="#000000">She burrowed tighter against him and to his astonishment, he heard her instantly, lightly snoring. </font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>He
wrapped his arms around her tighter and closed his eyes for what he
meant to be only a moment. He was bone weary too, but he didn't want to
sleep. There will be plenty of other nights to sleep. But tonight--his
first night inside, beside Chandra--he wanted to be awake until it
turned into a new day.<br><br>When he opened his eyes again, the wind
whistled through his arms and the flesh chilled where there should have
been warmth. He felt a swarm of pure desolation before he realized the
sun was beaming hot against the skin of his face. He sat up. <br><br>Everybody
was up and about. Some were eating, others talking. He rubbed his eyes,
slightly embarrassed, but still filled with the euphoria from the past
night.<br><br>The world was looking like a much brighter, better place.
Not only that, the people left in it, were looking brighter and better
too--even Jane. She was awake and quietly eating for the first time in
days. Mike was talking intimately with Feifong. Steve was spoon feeding
a giggling Ada. Sheree was looking in his direction, a wistful, faraway
smile on her lips. Janet sat beside her with her head on her shoulder.
Chandra was approaching him with a plate in her hand, more of her
perfect white teeth exposed than he had ever seen, her skin seemingly
glowing like a full moon, looking older, fleshier, in focus, real,
here--with him, his world--and twice as beautiful.<br><br><br>They all
waited for him to finish his meal. By the slightly rancid taste of the
food, another day or two was going to be the last of their synthetic
goods. The rest will have to be thrown away. <br><br>They passed
plenty of edible vegetation as they traveled. The heat that destroyed
the people of their world wasn't the dry, burning kind of heat that
killed plant life,&nbsp; it was the humid, sweltering kind that sucked
the life out of WoManbeings. They--the McCloud research team--had long
known that would be the case. Zeus' grudge wasn't against the earth or
nature.<br><br>Soon Chandra was going to have to show her mettle--not
that she hadn't already proven herself to be the prized contributor to
their survival that he knew a Rootswoman would be. Some of the edible
and medicinal vegetation were easily identified by them all, but they
could not stock up on most of it, and they could hoard none of it very
long. Soon plants will be scarcer, and less identifiable.<br>Some plant
life had already begun the adjustment to survive, when the breaches
first became noticeable by the scientific community after the atomic
explosions of World War II. The plant life was changing. Weaker plants
were taking on the looks and characteristics of stronger plants. That
process will accelerate in the aftermath of the great breach. He knew
that nothing could keep up with those changes but someone who was born
with the instincts of a Naturalist. Already Chandra pointed out to him
little things that he would have never seen or even knew was possible.
Her knowledge was inexplicable--especially for one who never studied
her craft at a higher institution.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></font></font></font></font></p></div>
