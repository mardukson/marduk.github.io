must be more to that kid than what I'd already thought. With all the
attention and money being thrown at him, the kid still hangs in there
and keeps his word. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">He'll arrive tomorrow and I'm going to be the first thing that he sees when he steps off that plane. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Time is of the essence and I just don't know how much more, my crew and I have. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">We
should have been aggressively recruiting Blacks long before this but
gotdammit, who would have thought the gotdamned government would use
those bombs in Iraq, after the entire world Community warned them that
they would be dooming WoMankind. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Ten people. Ten gotdamned people out of 7 billion makes this kind of decision for us all? </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Leaves you wondering what's the point of anything. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">We
can invent. We can progress. If we wanted it enough, we can go as far
in this universe as we can dream but what the hell is the point? </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">One or two more breaches and the light-skinned people of this world are over. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I
suspect since myself and my entire team were outside, at the worse possibly place,&nbsp; during the breach,
most, if not all of us, are already poisoned by radiation. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Nobody wants to find out because what purpose will it serve but to sap us even more of our will to carry on our work? </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The Blacks have more time--especially those who were not outside during the breach. But even their days are numbered. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The
deterioration of the ozone is irreversible. We've long known that. But
if it had never been breached, there might have been a way to send up
another form of mist to bolster the earth's shield from undiluted UV
rays. We might have bought ourselves centuries or even a couple of
millenniums--enough time to colonize other planets. But now, there is a
hole in the ozone and the window of an environmental solution has been
permanently closed. Years of work and research rendered useless. Now we
have to focus entirely on finding a biological solution. We have to
find a cure for skin cancer and a way to prevent it. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The
people are eventually going to be limited strictly to life indoors. We
could build more underground cities but we have run out of time for
even that to be a solution but for a fraction of WoMankind. Even this
is no permanent solution and once the sun breaks through the ozone for
good, man will never be able to resurface again--even in enclosed
structures. We will never be able to cool our ships long enough to get
a live crew out of the earth's atmosphere. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Maybe
this is the promised hell that the biblical Prophets promised us if we
didn't change our evil ways. Maybe by "hell" they meant an entire
gotdamned earth destroyed by our own greed and selfishness. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">I'm
not going to survive long enough to find an answer but this kid
Damian...I've read the young man's book; pure genius. If there is an
answer this kid will find it. And it is my intention to do everything I
can to help him along the path before I go. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Nothing comes before this kid. </font></font></p><p></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><i>Nothing! <b></b></i></font></font></p><p><!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--></p></div><div></div><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden"> </b></font></font><div></div><!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--></body></html>
