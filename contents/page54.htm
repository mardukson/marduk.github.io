four months, Ada thought she was getting pretty good with a drop kick.
She felt so despite Bruce&nbsp; yelling at her that she'll never get
it. <br><br>Everyone was so wound up and edgy, especially Steve. She
thought about how much she used to love him. So much that it hurt. So
much that it felt better to let him go than to live with having less
than all of him to herself. When he slept with Jane that night, she had
actually felt relieved. He was already building walls between them,
pulling away from her, showing annoyance with her.<br>She was in agony
thinking she was losing him, but she wasn't really losing him. He
wanted to experiment-- see what was on the other side of the fence. She
knew he still loved her. At one point in her life, what Steve did
wouldn't even have bothered her. But then again, it's easy not to be
possessive if you don't feel true love. She could have forgiven
him--taken him back--but she felt so much better in heartbreak than in
love, she decided not to .<br><br>Now she had Chako. Steve showed her what real love is. Chako showed her that you can find it twice. <br><br>She
still loved Steve, just like Jane still loved him. It's hard not to
love Steve once you know the man inside the clown. He was so genuine
and guileless--not in the childish way of the Iowees, but in a manly
way, the way of a true man of honor--a knight in shining armor. He felt
things so deeply, and was so shameless in acting on his principals,
even when he got on his soapbox, or said something to hurt your
feelings, it never made you mad, because you knew he was real, it was
never about winning arguments, or oneupmanship with Steve. It was
always about his heart. What he had inside.<br><br>Seeing him so
committed to preparing himself to actually fight, and maybe die to free
the Natives on that Island only reinforced to everyone that all those
fits of anger, all the rants, the almost embarrassing loyalty to
Damian, <i>everything</i> that he has said and done over the years was
really Steve. He was a very unique man, and all the women who loved
him, Jane, Michelle, herself were enamored of him.<br><br>She was glad that Damian and Steve were so determined to liberate those people. And she was happy to have a role in it.<br>She
just wished she felt better about their odds of success. They can train
forever, and all become as good a fighter as Bruce, but eleven Bruces
against fifty Bruces still adds up to defeat. <br>She knew the men
were working on a strategy to even the odds some, but she couldn't stop
herself from adding up the numbers and believing they were going to die
on that Island.<br><br>Sometimes she thought about Sheba; saw pictures
in her mind of the big cat tearing through that compound in a fury. It
was the one thing that shone light on the darkness of her fear.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </div>
