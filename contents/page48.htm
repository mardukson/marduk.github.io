She was a wild looking thing, nearly unrecognizable as people, under
the dirt, rags, and the wild mass of hair that was housing almost
everything that grew in the jungle.<br><br>Bruce, who had an ear out
for the Iowees even though no one expected any trouble, heard them
scream. He was probably the only person in their group who could run
faster than Chandie. Three point nine speed, a soldier's ability to
swiftly and calmly assess a situation and a deep love for the Iowees
was the only thing that saved the wild thing's life. <br><br>Bruce got
to the scene just as the big cat crouched. He instantly recognized
before him, a person about to be leaped on by a 300 pound cat who
thought she was protecting the terrified, screaming Iowees.<br><br><font color="#800040">"Down! Sheba. Down girl!"</font><font color="#000000"> Bruce Yelled.</font><font color="#800040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The
big cat turned at the sound his voice. She looked at the Iowees, who
had run to Bruce and were now quiet. She turned away from the thing she
was about to kill and sidled over to stand beside the Iowees.<br><br>Bruce
looked at the wild thing, who was standing there, still frozen with the
fear of coming into a clearing and finding herself face-to-face with a
fang baring tiger. <br><br>He saw that she was hurt and bleeding. He stepped towards her. She screamed, and took of running like a deer. <br><br>During
his days in College, as a star cornerback for Virginia Tech college, he
didn't have to run as far to catch top rated halfbacks from behind. <br><br>Hurt,
as she was, the wild thing still ran faster than that guy who was the
top draft pick for the Washington Redskins football team his senior
year who they said--when he played against him--was as fast as that
year's Olympic sprint champion. He caught him from behind too--just
like all the rest. <br><br>By the time he caught her, the wild thing
would have been in the End zone. But he did catch her, and nearly got
his eyeballs scratched out for the effort. She was fighting like she
thought he was trying to rape or kill her.<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"You need medical attention...sorry."</font><font color="#000000"> He pinched a nerve in her neck, and she went out like a light. He threw her over his shoulders and started walking.</font><font color="#800040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>The
big cat, who was now lounging under Chandra's feet, saw them first. Her
ears stood straight up as she rose off her haunches. Chandra looked
where the cat was looking and gasped. She started running towards
Bruce. Her emissions alerted the others and they all stopped what they
were doing and started approaching Bruce<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" What happened to she?"</font><font color="#000000"> Chandra asked Bruce.</font><font color="#0000ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040">"I'll tell you what I know later. She's okay but her arms, wrists and hands are cut badly."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Damian
helped Bruce ease the female off Bruce's shoulder. The two supported
her between them as they carried her towards the tent they set up as
Chandra's "emergency room."<br><br></font><font color="#008080">" What happened to her?" </font><font color="#000000">Steve, the last one to arrive, asked.</font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040">" Besides me putting her to sleep with a nerve pinch I don't really know."<br><br></font><font color="#008080">"Why did you do that?"<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"Because she was hysterical, and about to beat me to death out there."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Bruce and Damian carried her inside the tent. They laid her down on the covered ground.<br><br><br><br></font><font color="#800080">"How did you come across her?"</font><font color="#000000">
Damian looked at the unconscious woman and saw that she was very
young--no more than eighteen years old.&nbsp; Even under all the dirt,
her beauty was evident. She was a light-skinned Africoid woman, looked
like one of those mix-raced Models who were always the faces of the
Islands' tourist industry.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040">"She
came up over the ridge...I think running from something, or some one. I
heard the Iowees scream and got to the scene just in time to stop Sheba
from jumping on her. I saw that she was hurt, went to help her and she
took off like a bat out of hell. I chased her. When I caught her she
almost tore my face off. I think she's been raped, or otherwise
attacked by someone. The cuts on her arms and hands look like defensive
knife wounds. I don't know what the burns on her wrists come
from...rope maybe."<br><br></font><font color="#0000ff">" I've got to tek she dirty clothes off."</font><font color="#000000"> Chandra said. She asked Bruce, </font><font color="#0000ff">"weh she gwan wek up?"<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"Any second now."</font><font color="#000000"> Bruce started moving towards the exit. Damian followed him out of the tent.</font><font color="#800040"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800080">"Knife wounds?"</font><font color="#000000"> Damian asked as he and Bruce walked side-by-side.</font><font color="#800080"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800040">"I'm pretty sure."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">"That means there are other people on the Island beside us and the girl."<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"Yeah."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" You really think she was raped?"<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"
I've come on the scene a few times after women had been raped, or,
otherwise brutally traumatized. That's what she acted like when she
fought me. She was frenetic."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" So there's at least one dangerous person around somewhere. "<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"At
least one. But in my experience Damian, predatory people are like deer
trying to cross the road at night. It's not the first one that fucks
your car up, it's always one, of the two or three others running behind
him. In other words, I think there might be more than two people left
alive on this Island. And they aint nice."<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" What makes you say that?"<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"Look
at the girl. She's been living like a hunted animal for a long time.
One man don't keep anybody on the run like that in this much space.
She's being terrorized by a few people. <br>
"<br></font><font color="#800080">"I guess that answers my next question."<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"What's that?"<br><br></font><font color="#800080">" Do we move on or stay.<br><br></font><font color="#800040">"Yeah I guess it does."<br><br><br><br></font><font color="#000000">***************<br><br><br></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"
I'm going Steve, and that's final. I know a hell of a lot more about
fighting than you do. And I'm also a Medic. Chandra is staying in camp
to watch over the injured girl, so who do you suggest is more qualified
than me to go?"</span><br><br></font><font color="#000000">Steve put up his hands. </font><font color="#008080">" You're right. Excuse me for wanting my woman to stay safe like all the other women."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080"><br></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">" I really don't feel like doing this right now."</span> </font><font color="#000000">She tucked her knife in her waistband and picked up her spear.</font><font color="#ff80ff"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#008080">" I'm sorry Shelly, It's just that I--"<br><br></font><font color="#000000">She pressed him. </font><font style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);" color="#ff80ff">"It's just that you what?"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff80ff"><br></font><font color="#008080">"Never mind."<br><br></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"Are you ever going to say it to me, Steven?"</span><br><br></font><font color="#008080">" Shelly...I, I love you."<br></font><font color="#000000"><br>She put the spear down and moved into his arms.<br><br></font><font color="#ff80ff"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">"I love you too...so very much."</span><br><br><br></font><font color="#000000">It
was decided that Steve, Michelle, Bruce and Chako, would go with
Damian. Patrick and the rest of the women would stay in the Camp with
the Iowees. The big Cat was also supposed to stay, but she decided she
wanted to go. She acted like she was going to stay as told. Sat there
as obedient as a show dog, and watched until Damian and those with him
disappeared from sight. Then she got up and took off in a full stretch
after them before anyone could say gone.<br><br>She stayed on Steve's
left, just out of range of his stride. And as if she was deliberately
toying with him; when he stopped and playfully kicked at her every once
in a while, she would skip ahead just far enough so that he missed. And
then fall right back into the same range. <br><br></font><font color="#800040">"You have to keep it down, Steve." </font><font color="#000000">Bruce said. </font><font color="#800040">"Were on a reconnaissance mission and we don't want any potential enemies to spot us before we see them if we can avoid it."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">They
were out with their weapons trying to find out who was hunting the
young woman, and if any other people were being terrorized in the same
manner. <br><br>Suddenly the big cat's ears sprang up and she stood as stiff as a board. </font><font color="#800040">"Get low." </font><font color="#000000">Bruce hissed. Michelle and Chako instantly dropped into a crouch. Damian and Steve saw what the soldiers did, and followed suit.<br><br></font><font color="#800040">" One trick...,"</font><font color="#000000"> Bruce addressed Chako. </font><font color="#800040">"you go ahead and see what Sheba is reacting to."</font><font color="#000000">
The young Indian nodded and took off, moving quickly and quieter than a
tiger's shadow. The real tiger stayed right beside him.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> <div></div><div></div>&nbsp;<input id="track" name="track" type="hidden"> <div></div><!--<input name="down" type="button" value="down" onMouseOver="pressdown();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();"><input name="up" type="button" value="up" onMouseOver="pressup();" onMouseOut="mouse_out();">--></font></font></body></html>
