<div align="left"><font size="4">When Damian and the others appeared in
view of the boat, the Iowees ran to them, wild like with excitement and
tears. The little persons got hugs all around from the big people who
reveled in their exuberant affection.<br><br>"Where are Patrick and Bruce and Chako?" Firstshe asked, her huge eyes even wider in her tiny face.<br><br>Damian couldn't answer her. Neither could any of the others.<br><br>" Bruce dead." Firsthe said sadly.<br><br>" Is Sheba dead too." Firstshe asked.<br><br><font color="#800080">"No, no."</font><font color="#000000"> Damian said quickly. "</font><font color="#800080">Bruce isn't dead."</font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Just then the big cat came bounding up just ahead of Bruce and Chako.<br><br>"Sheba!"
the Iowees screeched in unison and ran to the cat. They hugged the
Tiger, and then each of them grabbed onto a part of their favorite
Soldier. Bruce and Chako were grinning from ear to ear.<br><br>The big cat was grinning too.<br><br></font></font></div>

<div align="center"><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><br></font></font></div>

<div align="left"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Jane was devastated by the news about Patrick. Despite how all the others had come to feel about him, she loved him deeply.<br><br>Bruce
and Chako each carried a memento of their fallen Comrades on a chain
they wore around their necks. Along with Lee, Tiararay, Alonzo, Kiesha,
Shakira, Felix, and Isabella, Patrick had his spirit permanently
attached to those chains.<br><br>As he promised, Mike stayed alive long
enough to get past the worse days of having to live for no one but
himself. After that he grew accustomed to his life as it was. <br><br>Damian
adored Feifong and he had never before been able to put his finger on
exactly why. Seeing her with Mike, he finally pinpointed it. It was her
ability to love without really needing or wanting to be loved in
return. When she let someone in her heart, she was&nbsp; selfless in
devotion to them. She never let Mike linger in depression.<br><br>Janet
literally blossomed like a rose. She seemed to not only get taller in
the weeks she was back, she also seemed to grow younger. Damian never
knew anyone who smiled so much. She was like a ray of sunshine that
brightened all their lives. She and Sheree were far beyond ever being
lovers again, but they were now closer than ever. Sometimes he would
see jealousy and anguish on Elizabeth's face, but sooner or later she
would have to come to accept that she was a beloved daughter to Sheree,
and Sheree loved her sons and daughters with all her heart, but Janet
was a soul mate.<br><br>Bruce and Chako found the big cat in the pit.
They had to dig down beside the hole to get her out. To this day she
had never thanked them. Bruce laughed when he told how the big cat had
walked out of the hole as aloof and regal as the queen of England.
Damian felt the cat was embarrassed.<br><br>They left Tameka and Mustafa on the Island of Trinidad.<br><br>Before
they began their long trip to Africa in earnest again, they stopped to
check on Elizabeth's people. They had only meant to stay long enough to
see if everything was well, and to say goodbye. <br><br>The dancing,
singing and revelry lasted for two days. And they were held captive
through it all. But there was nothing wrong with that kind of
captivity. The native women were beautiful. Nothing at all.<br><br>Finally,
they were again moving towards their new Genesis. The Liberty was a
mighty fine vessel, she was. And as Damian stood at her bow with his
feline shadow, beside him, staring across the waters, he couldn't help
feeling lucky when he reflected upon all the things a few Scientists,
and a couple of teachers had made it through. They weren't supposed to
be the last ones standing. But they have outlasted elite Warriors,
Kings, Queens, Millionaires and Billionaires, Militias and Religious
groups, Gangs and Armies. <br><br>Lucky indeed<br><br>At least so far<br><br>The Journey continues....<br><br><br><br><font color="#0000cc">If you enjoyed this Novel, check out these other works from marmuseworks.com <br><br><img src=".%5Cimage85.jpg" border="0" height="220" width="200"> <br>THE ALBUM <br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage86.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="190"> <br>THE NOVEL <br><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage87.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="200"> <br>THE ALBUM <br></font></font></font><embed src="file://C:%5CUsers%5Ctomas%5CDesktop%5CcontentsNG%5Crhyme2weep%28promo%29.mp3" loop="FALSE" autostart="false" height="40" width="300"><font size="4"><font color="#000000"><font color="#0000cc"> <font size="2">promo song
