phone on Damian's nightstand sounded so loud, he halfway marveled that
the walls weren't shaking and that the picture hanging above his
head--the one of dread-locked Jesus-- hadn't fallen down and knocked
him a lump. Maybe it sounded so loud because it's been so long since
it's rung in the still of the night...not that it woke him up. He
hadn't fallen into a real sleep in over a month. </font></font><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He
let it rang a few times longer than it had to. If it's Sheree calling,
he couldn't let her know how anxious and desperate he was to hear from
her.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">On the sixth ring he picked the phone up. It was McCloud--a
blue-haired, ancient, bent, yellow-toothed, four-eyed, lab coat looking
like a Picasso doodle wearing, pain in the ass...calling him at three
o'clock in the fucking morning, when he was fantasizing and praying about
beauty, fragrance, femininity, breasts, black hair, white teeth, soft,
full lips.<br>
</font></font></p>

<p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">That old man was really starting to become an object of resentment in his life. </font></font></p>
<p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Hallo...Damian, Damian...You there son...Hallo?"</font> </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian didn't know whether to spit or speak. <i>What the hell is he calling me at three o'clock in the morning for?</i></font> </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Yes sir, it's Damian." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><i>What you want pops?</i></font> </font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">"Oh, Damian...glad to reach you, son.

He lightly sat the phone down on the night stand, laid down, turned and pulled up the covers<i>. That old man just did not have to call me in the middle of the night to remind me of anything.</i> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
next time Damian heard the phone, it was demanding to be hung up. He
cradled it and peered at the clock. He had plenty of time to get ready
but he got up and turned on the shower anyway. He wouldn't want to be
two seconds late and give Mr. McCloud a heart attack. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
stepped outside his apartment door and felt like he was under some
giant kid's magnifying glass. The sun was directly above him, beaming
down so hard, he broke out into a pouring sweat and could have sworn he
smelt meat burning--his meat. He raced back into his penthouse
apartment--the pad that was so modern he might as well have been living
on another planet when he was inside. He had absolutely no idea it was
so hot outdoors. He felt terrified. The breach problem had just taken a
turn for the worse. The phone was ringing. He found his darkest pair of
sunglasses, grabbed his wide brim hat and dashed out the door. He
wasn't late but he knew who was calling and suddenly the old man's
presence, voice, or splotchy lab coat became the most important and
most comforting thing that he could think of. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He had to see Mr. McCloud. </font></font></font></p></div></body></html>
