was an answer in what Mr. McCloud, showed him three weeks ago in that
Petri dish. All he could think about since then, was perfecting
McCloud's discovery while he still had the time. Haven't even given
much thought to Sheree lately at all, even though she's been blowing
his answering machine up with calls. He needed to see her, if for
nothing else but the sake of common decency but he has been utterly
unable to drag himself from the lab;sleeping on a cot next to his
workstation, ordering pizza, starring at that Petri dish from sunup to
sundown. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">Woody,
or the little guy he playfully called, Woody, died from cancer three
days ago. Two others of his crew are on their death beds. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">McCloud,
Steve, Ada, the Englishman and Mike seemed to be doing fine but he's
losing everyone else. Jenna--the tall blond headed woman, will probably
be the next to succumb. He only slept with her a few times but he grew
very fond of her and her utter impartiality in how she distributed her
charms; her long, beautiful legs-- legs she never hesitated to expose
right up to the apex to him &nbsp;every chance she got--legs that she
still refused to cover up even though they now resembled Olive Oil's
more than Betty Gable's. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He
had spent the last few days scouring the Universities and big
businesses, trying to find some melaninated scientists to join his
team. So far he found two who had some qualifications in the field.
Both promised to give his offer serious consideration. But they were
miles behind every member of his team in the breach research and would
need considerable drilling to catch up. He needed them but he knew even
if they decided to join his team, they were going to be a while in
adding anything useful to the research. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">There
was a man in Southern Africa, named Maguthaba. It was a name he kept
coming across every time he read a research paper or journal on the
subject of the breach. The man seemed to be more respected in the
field, than even McCloud. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">From
what he read, the entire Scientific community had turned not to Harvard
and McCloud but to the University of Zimbabwe and Maguthaba as their
last and best hope. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He
wondered if Maguthaba knew of McCloud's discovery and if McCloud knew
everything that the African scientist knew. It was strange that McCloud
never mentioned Maguthaba to him. </font></font></font></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He
resisted the thought that McCloud could have been enmeshed in some kind
of ridiculous professional rivalry with professor Maguthaba. Then
again, why haven't the two most knowledgeable people in the world on
the breach situation gotten together at this point where WoMankind was
teetering on the brink of extinction? </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">He will ask McCloud to explain but first he had to get in contact with Mr. Maguthaba. </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">"You really do need to shave." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Damian looked around and saw the Pipsqueak standing in the doorway with her left hand on her hip.</font><font class="fsx06" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"> "And a shower too.

Her voice sounded strange, low and slightly breathless, like something

she hated him from the moment they met.</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">"</font><font class="fsx06" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Please?"</font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><i>What the hell?</i></font> </font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><i>"</i>Pip,

no way he should have been so insensitive. Her friends were dying all
around her--probably family members too. She was close to Woody and he
knew that-- even though Jenna was the only one who was bad enough to
give the skinny little man some dip. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He
was more stressed out than he knew. Before today he was being extra
nice to her because of Woody's death and because she had actually
started sending him some unexpectedly strange vibes. Though he had
spent many a night fantasizing about her and what Steve called the
eighth and ninth wonders of the world in the beginning, he just didn't
want to be bothered with her and what she was suddenly needing, or
wanting right now. Seemed like everybody was suddenly needing a piece
of him that they didn't want three weeks before. </font></font></font></font></p><p></p><p><font class="fsx10" face="Times New Roman"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">But
what the hell, it wasn't going to kill him. He needed to get himself
together and start living like people again. What better way to do that
than to accept what she was offering.
