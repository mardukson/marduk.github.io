<div align="left"><font size="4"><b><br></b><br><img alt="" src=".%5Cimage68.jpg" border="0" height="221" width="167"> Lee<br><br><br><font color="#0080c0">"Sir,"<font color="#000000"> Shakira leaned over the big hole and yelled.</font><font color="#0080c0"> "Here they come."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee
put down the shovel and wiped his hands on his pants. Alonzo, Felix,
Kiesha, Isabella, and Tiararay, calmly chose their weapons and started
climbing out of the hole. Lee followed them.<br><br>He had known about
it, the very minute when the Drakes had arrived. They were sloppy,
nothing near the professionals they were 6 years ago when they had
surprised him and took the Iowees from him.<br><br>They had him
outnumbered and he'd thought long and hard about the implications of
that. This was low tech warfare, as primitive as it got; nothing was
going to win this day but skill, stamina, numbers and muscle.
Advantage: Drakes.<br><br>He would have killed them when he had the
chance if he knew his people would balk at crossing the ocean, or had
any inkling that he would lose Chako, Patrick and Bruce.<br><br>Maybe
what he should have done was order them all to get on the boat. He was
sure Damian was still alive somewhere--he and his crew. Another time,
another day, another place, he <i>would</i> have ordered them to go,
and shot anybody who refused, but he wouldn't have had to shoot anyone.
All he had to do was give the order. They would have obeyed him. But he
no longer felt he had the right to assert that kind of authority over
them. Why...he didn't know. They were still under oath. He was still
their Commanding officer. For all they knew Command quarters was still
alive and functioning someplace.<br><br>Then again he did know. It was when he looked at the world around him. Saw how small he was. How insignificant. He was little, t<i>oo</i>
little to have command over somebody's life in a world where the faces
weren't just a blur of unidentifiable multitudes, but clear, distinct,
so few, he not only knew every living person left alive in the part of
the world he inhabited, he knew every personality, every quirk, every
ounce of them--like a part of his own body. It's easy to not see a man,
woman, body part; to take for granted what you didn't really need to
survive. Easy to treat their existence like your own possession, to do
with what you will, to kill, to order them to kill themselves, when you
can replace them with a million others, like changing socks. But when
there are no multitudes, when there are just a few, and you lose a man,
a body part, you feel it, you really see how small and weak you are,
and how losing that body part renders you even weaker and smaller.
That's when you begin to see that if you aren't God almighty, you're
just too little--too&nbsp; goddamn little for anything but bossing
around yourself.<br><br>********************<br><br><br>Lee and his group stood waiting calmly as they watched the Drakes approach.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"What you doing with that hole, Lee?" </font><font color="#000000">Antonio led his unit to within a few yards of the Dragonhunters, stopped and raised his hand.</font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000">" Trying to survive, Tony. Maybe you should try it too."<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" Very funny. Don't waste time trying to bullshit me, Lee. You know what's going to happen today."<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Doesn't
have to, Tony. Look around you. Take a good look. What do you see?
Hear? Not a goddamn thing in this whole world but us. We can kill one
another, but why? The Iowees aren't here. And there's nobody to pin any
medals on you-- no daddy sitting behind a desk in a uniform to pat you
on the head and give you that acceptance your real daddy never gave
you."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Antonio laughed at the bespectacled Soldier. </font><font color="#ff0000">"You
know the biggest problem with giving Niggers access to books Lee? They
start believing and absorbing every goddamn thing they read. They think
everybody who writes a book is Confucius. But a white man knows who
writes the books; the Psychology books, the Science books, the
Religious books, the History books, because it was probably some twerp
whose face he farted in when they were kids. We don't take 'em that
seriously Lee, so don't waste your time trying to psychobabble me"</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000"><br><br></font><font color="#000000">Now it was Lee's time to laugh. </font><font color="#800000">"That's good Tony. But what I'm saying to you is we have no reason to fight and kill anymore."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"And that brings us to the major difference between you and me, Lee. <i>You're</i> the one who had a <i>reason</i> to fight and kill. "<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee
knew then, that trying to talk his way out of a fight was impossible,
but he wanted to try one more thing because on the faces of a few of
Antonio's people, he could see some kind of uncertainty.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">" You know there's going to be another breach in three years, Tony. If we don't finish this bunker, we're all going to fry."<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"
You're chickenshit, Lee. Always have been, always will be. That's why
in the end you always wind up as soup for guys like me. You should be
on a boat with that boy, but here you are digging a goddamn grave. And
don't think I don't know why. I know you, Lee. And I know if you had
imposed your will like you were supposed to, you would be on that boat.
Chickenshit. I seen it in your eyes the first time I saw you. That's
why you're going to die, and that's why you deserve to die. But I'm
going to give you a choice, just like you once gave me a choice. We can
stab you to death, or beat you to death. Whichever you want. Your call."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee
couldn't believe the man would cut his advantage like that. The odds
were still heavily in his favor, but it was senseless for him to take
such a risk in a fight to the death.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">" Alright. I choose to fight without weapons but how do I know you'll stick to that if we throw down ours?"<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"
The code of honor between warriors. I'm not the kind of goody-good
soldier you are, but despite what you think, I'm still a warrior with
honor.<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Alright, we'll throw our weapons in the hole and move up there to neutral ground." </font><font color="#000000">Lee nodded at the men and women around him. They all threw their knives and spears in the hole.</font><font color="#800000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000">"Toss 'em." </font><font color="#000000">Antonio ordered. His troops stepped up and threw in all their weapons. </font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#000000"><br>"</font><font color="#800000"> Let's go."</font><font color="#000000"> Lee started walking. His group started after him.<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" Leave the Civs behind Lee. They can't help you in a fight anyway."<br><br></font><font color="#800000">"Why...so you can have them at your mercy if we lose? They chose if they want to fight or not."<br><br></font><font color="#ff0000">" Janet...I swear. I won't hurt you. Stay behind."<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Antonio pleaded.</span><br><br></font><font color="#0000a0">" Fuck you, Tony."</font><font color="#000000"> Felix snarled.</font><font color="#0000a0"> " Don't talk to her."<br><br></font><font color="#000000">Antonio ignored him.</font><font color="#ff0000">
"And I won't hurt the other Civ. I give you my word, Warrior's code of
honor. Just stay behind baby...I'm sorry for hitting you. It'll never
happen again."</font><font color="#000000"><br></font><font color="#ff0000"><br></font><font color="#ff0080">" It won't?"</font><font color="#000000"> Janet started walking towards Antonio. </font><font color="#ff0080">" Let's see." </font><font color="#000000">She stopped a few feet in front of him and leaned into his face. </font><font color="#ff0080">"<i>Fuck </i>you." </font><font color="#000000">Then
she stood there watching him changing colors, looking into his eyes as
the pupil's got tiny with rage. But he didn't lash out at her. Finally
she turned and walked back to Lee. </font><font color="#ff0080">"I wanna fight." <br><br></font><font color="#000000">Lee
had trained her in combat--she and Mike. She wasn't up to par with any
of the female soldiers, but she wasn't defenseless either. <br><br>Mike
said nothing, but he didn't have to. As he stood there beside Shakira,
the look on his face said everything anybody had to know, to realize
what he was going to do.<br><br>******************<br><br><br>Alonzo
"Big house" Briener threw the first punch. Knocked another one of
Mustafa's teeth out. The two men had been staring at each other from
the moment the Drakes showed up in Lee's camp. Mustafa's smirk didn't
hold the amusement it did when he trained it on Damian--aimed at Alonzo
it was full of challenge and disrespect. Big House was aching to push
it into the back of Mustafa's neck. Mustafa had barely turned after
they reached the designated fighting area before his face stopped a
hard rock fist in full swing. <br><br>Mustafa hit the dirt, blood
spurting from his already crooked nose. Mustafa rolled and pushed
himself up from the dirt and Alonzo kicked him so hard two of
Mustafa's&nbsp; recently healed ribs cracked again. Alonzo stood--eyes
beaming triumphant as he watched with satisfaction, the groaning
Mustafa. </font></font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000">John
Huang watched Alonzo. He didn't even approach him quietly because he
was enraged. Alonzo still didn't notice him because he was so focused
on Mustafa. John Huang took Big House's leg out from under him with a
side kick that would have snapped an electrical pole in half. Alonzo's
knee joint snapped, and the big man fell to the ground rolling and
screaming in agony.<br><br>Mustafa got up. The blood that dribbled down
his chin was nothing compared to the bloodlust that was in his wild
eyes as he went for the disabled Alonzo Briener.<br><br>John Huang turned from them to see who else he could take down.<br><br>Suddenly Mike came rushing at John and took him down. <br><br>Forgot
all his combat training and charged in like a bull seeing a red
flag--the same way he did, when he tackled and windmilled at Rick that
day, and took a boot in the face from John Huang. This time, John was
taking it in the face--again and again and again from Mike's wild,
furious punches. <br><br>Sonya was in that black place, and she was
completely overpowering Tiararay. She could fight a lot of
professionally trained men to a standstill when she entered that place
of darkness.
</font></font></font></p><p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000">By
the way she let her nails grow, it was evident that Tiararay had lost
that edge, that instinct, that desire that it took to be an effective
fighter. She had her mind in a peaceful, domestic mode. She still had
skills, which the reflexes of alone, made her a formidable foe, but
Sonya fought like a maniac. She lost herself in it. She fought dirty
and ruthlessly. She was killing Lee's woman--just like she did that
lady during that traffic accident.<br><br><i>The accident...when she lost her baby.<br><br>That poor woman. She never meant to beat her that way. <br>
</i></font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000"><i>Her
baby. She saw her baby; bloody, neck broken. She was in shock. Got out
of the car. Saw the woman coming towards her. She wanted to tell the
woman about her baby. She didn't know who the woman was. Didn't know
she was involved in the accident. She just wanted the angelic woman to
help her baby. The woman was cursing and screaming from the moment she
saw her, but she didn't know it. Couldn't hear her. She couldn't hear
anything. <br><br>The woman got closer. Her hands were waving, her
lips were in a snarl, her eyes were flashing, but what she saw was an
angel sent from God, who had come to help her baby. <br><br>"My baby."
She said, and the woman raked her nails across her face. The pain was
excruciating. Everything turned to red, then black.<br><br>And then a Cop hit her with a billyclub with all his strength. <br><br></i>Janet
hit Sonya with all her might. And then she hit her again. Even then,
Sonya didn't react like she was hurt. She just stopped punching
Tiararay and rolled off her. Then she sat there beside the unconscious
woman and sobbed like she was never going to stop. <br>Janet watched
Sonya, crouched in a combat stance; saw that she wasn't going to do
anything but sit there. She knelt down and took Tiararay's pulse. She
was dead. Janet reached under Tiararay's arms and started dragging her
off the battlefield.<br><br>Kiesha and Tameka were fighting evenly
matched, blow for blow. Then Kiesha looked over and saw Alonzo on the
ground. Mustafa had him in a neck hold. Alonzo looked liked he had
already been kicked to death. Kiesha knew that neck hold. She saw
Mustafa lips say something just before he turned Alonzo's head almost
completely around. She screamed, called his name, reached for him.
Tameka punched her in the throat, took her voice and her wind. Then
Tameka leaped and spun. Kiesha fell to the ground, her neck as broken
as Alonzo's, her arms reaching out towards him, her eyes empty of life.<br><br>David
Bravefeather killed Isabella in four quick moves. He ducked the swing
she took at him, grabbed her arm and got behind her, kissed her on the
neck, then he yanked her head back as hard as he could, breaking her
spine. <br><br>He then looked around and saw Mike on top of John.<br><br>Shakira's
face was unrecognizable as human. Her mouth was a mass of blood and
flesh, both her lips were split in half, her left eye was shut and her
nose was a bloody pulp. Still, Mesha looked worse, and was now on the
ground crawling, mewling like a newborn kitten for it's mother's teat.
Shakira answered each pathetic small cry with another kick. Finally
Mesha fell flat and stopped moving.<br><br>Then Shakira fell flat too.<br>
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000">When
Bravefeather made the decision to rescue&nbsp; John Huang from Mike's
fury, first, Mesha was still standing. Bravefeather didn't see when his
on/off again lover fell but he saw when and how she died. It enraged
him. He left John to take revenge on Mike by himself. At full speed, he
ran up to Shakira and leaped in the air, kicking her in the back so
hard, the sound of Shakira's neck breaking was like a gunshot. She fell
to the ground, dead before she hit the dirt.<br><br><br>With his first
counter move, Lee broke Antonio's right arm. The fight between them was
really decided at that moment. But Antonio was still fighting back
twenty minutes later.<br><br>He was on one knee now, preparing himself
to take yet another kick to the head instead of lying down. It wouldn't
have mattered if he lay down or not and somewhere in the back of his
disoriented brain, Antonio knew it. Lee was determined to kill him this
time. <br><br>John and Tameka were holding a struggling, Janet. Mike
lay stretched out on the ground like a dead man, still breathing only
because John remembered Antonio's order, not to kill the Civs. <br><br>Felix
and Rick had fought the longest, most brutal battle of them all. Felix
seemingly won, beating Rick so bad, the blond soldier was on the ground
writhing in some kind of seizure. David Bravefeather, and Mustafa--even
though his broken ribs tortured him with pain--was slowly bearing down
on Felix, grimly determined to make the exhausted soldier pay dearly
for that victory over Rick. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000">Felix was
already dead--dead tired. He was also bleeding like a waterfall,
internally, but he kept fighting and Lee knew why. But it didn't matter
anymore. Nothing mattered anymore--not even finishing off Antonio. Lee
ran past Antonio, determined to do for Felix, what Felix did for him.
He started swinging and kicking, screaming in a high pitched, sustain
wail as he gave up mastery over his mind and body to a whirling dance
of death. <br>
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000">Felix
dropped to his knees and fell on his face. Bravefeather stomped him in
the back of the neck with all his 200 pounds, but Felix was already
dead from a hit the master kickboxer Rick, had scored beneath his
heart, halfway in their fight.<br><br>Mike had hurt John Huang, but
most of the wild punches were blocked by the Asian soldier. If not for
orders, he would have killed Mike. He had no such orders regarding Lee.
He saw Antonio and Rick and Mesha lying still on the ground. He
screamed with rage and went for the last Dragonhunter still standing. <br>
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#0080c0"><font color="#000000">The last
thing the bone tired, and probably insane Lee saw was more colors in
his emptied mind. He never saw John Huang's running, driving kick aimed
at the back of his head.<!--YOUR SCROLL CONTENT HERE--> </font></font></font></p>
