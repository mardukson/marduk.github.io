you cant have my mind<br>
you cant have my soul<br>
you cant put my reality<br>
under your control<br>

sell me a bridge<br>
is it in brooklyn<br>
might be golden<br>
but i'm still there looking<br>
for the trick<br>
to be precise<br>
you cant sell me a brick just because you look nice<br>
say itz from god in his own voice<br>
i'm still looking 'round for the trojan horse<br>
if it don't look good then it aint good<br>
if it don't sound wood then it aint wood<br>
if it don't do right then it aint right<br>
if it don't act nice then it aint nice<br>
it aint mind over matter itz matter over mind<br>
i believe when i'm seeing not when i'm blind<br>
trying to tell me that a mouse is an elephant<br>
what you got down on paper is irrelavent<br>
I live by my concience not by the nonsense<br>
pointing to a demon calling it an angel<br>
cursing me and then calling it a blessing<br>
i'll call you a liar without photographing<br>
you gotta be crazy or you gotta be laughing<br>

    <h3>Mardukson - Woulditbe</h3>
<br>
 <p>would it be such a good thing<br>
if the highest mountain never fell<br>
the greenest valley never fried<br>
and the happiest people never cried<br>
would it be such a good thing<br>
if nobody believed in hell<br>
the deepest ocean never dried<br>
and the luckiest people never sighed<br>
would it be such a good thing<br>
if i never felt the pain<br>
that i help put in the rain
