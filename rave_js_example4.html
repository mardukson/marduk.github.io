<p><b>Example 4 </b></p>
<p>This example loads and opens an external playlist at startup.</p>
<p>As you can see, we've simply over-written the &quot;wimpyApp&quot; variable that was previously defined within rave.js. Since rave.js is loaded in the &lt;head&gt; of this HTML page all the variables are already established and we can change thier value as needed in the &lt;body&gt; portion of this page just before the player gets rendered.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: One might think to use the <strong>wimpy_loadExternalPlaylist</strong> or <strong>wimpy_appendPlaylist</strong> functions immediately after <font color="#0000FF"><strong>makeWimpyPlayer</strong></font>. Attempting to call these functions will not work because it takes a couple seconds for wimpy to initialize. It is best to use these functions as &quot;user input&quot; functions, where a user has to click on something in order for it to ocur. </p>
  <p>The only other alternative would be to use the <strong>wimpy_amReady_ask</strong> function to check to see if Wimpy is ready to accept function calls. Once wimpy_amReady_ask returns &quot;true&quot; you can use any given function to communicate with Wimpy. </p>
