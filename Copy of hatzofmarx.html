<h3>hatzofmar album</h3>

<p>This is the &quot;<span style="color:#0000FF;">HatzofMar&quot;</span> Album. I named it that because it is a mixture of different genres. It basically tells the story of a man who takes the best lover of his life for granted. He loses her to slickster who woos her with attention and excitement. He realizes too late what he had and fails to get her back.</p>

	<h3>Mardukson - Makeup</h3>
	&nbsp;

	<p>this morning i watched her put her dress on<br />
	and i wondered why she wore her best one<br />
	and as she made her face up in the mirror<br />
	for the first time i notice she had her hair done<br />
	when i asked her where she was going<br />
	all she would say to me was out<br />
	and as she left she told me not to wait up<br />
	and it hit me when she left the house<br />
	<br />
	she almost never wears make up<br />
	why did she suddenly get her hair done<br />
	and what did she mean by dont wait up<br />
	how late do she plan on coming home<br />
	<br />
	how late did she plan on coming home<br />
	<br />
	this morning i watched her as she came home<br />
	the clock read seven twenty-one<br />
	and when she saw me standing in the doorway<br />
	she said by now i thought you&#39;d be gone<br />
	as she walked passed me to the bedroom<br />
	i noticed that the makeup on her face<br />
	was running around the eyes and new hairdo<br />
	was sticking out in every place<br />
	<br />
	she almost never wore makeup<br />
	why did she suddenly get her hair done<br />
	and when she told me not to wait up<br />
	did she plan to stay up all night long<br />
	<br />
	this morning i left as she lay sleeping<br />
	but deep inside i knew there had to be<br />
	a reason why this woman who had always<br />
	been so true and faithful to me<br />
	<br />
	almost never wore make up<br />
	what reason did i give her to get her hair done<br />
	and how many nights did she wait up<br />
	for me and i never came home<br />
	<br />
	she almost never wore makeup<br />
	<br />
	she almost never wore makeup<br />
	<br />
	she almost never wore makeup<br />

	<h3>Mardukson - Seasons</h3>
	&nbsp;

	<p>even now as i saw you<br />
	my heart skipped a beat<br />
	cause i still love you<br />
	just as much as i ever did<br />
	my feelings for you haven&#39;t weakened a bit<br />
	every emotion is just as strong<br />
	and it seems itz not gonna matter how long<br />
	we&#39;re apart<br />
	you&#39;ll be still in my heart<br />
	tearing it apart like a poison dart<br />
	no not like cupid&#39;s arrow<br />
	why&#39;d you have to fly away little sparrow and leave me<br />
	just because the season changed you know<br />
	thatz not a good reason cause loves supposed<br />
	to stay forever and not bale out with the change of the weather<br />
	along with sunshine always comes rain but seasons<br />
	aint no reason to change<br />
	<br />
	girl i thought that what we had<br />
	was something so special it was bound to last a lifetime<br />
	that forever you&#39;d be mine image how it made me feel<br />
	to find out that you didn&#39;t love me anymore<br />
	you flipped on me girl and when i ask what for<br />
	all you can say is that things have changed<br />
	well thatz not good enough you got to explain<br />
	how a love that was once so true<br />
	can turn a 360 right out of the blue<br />
	i remember a time when you used to do anything for me<br />
	me anything for you but when times got hard<br />
	girl you didn&#39;t stay strong<br />
	after i lost my job you didn&#39;t stay long<br />
	thatz not the whole story but all the same<br />
	seasons aint no reason to change<br />
	<br />
	you know the thing i miss most of all is not the good times<br />
	though at times we had a ball<br />
	itz the times to come that i wont be a part of<br />
	like to the kids being a fulltime father<br />
	even though you dont love me i would&#39;ve been<br />
	illing to hold it together just for them<br />
	but the main reason would&#39;he been cause i love you<br />
	even now i&#39;m still thinking of you as mine<br />
	no matter how much time<br />
	passes me by itz still in my mind the season<br />
	when love brought together me and<br />
	you as young lovers believing<br />
	in happily ever after<br />
	and i would give anthing now to recapture<br />
	those lazy hazy days of summer change had to come<br />
	but still i wonder<br />
	how it would&#39;hve been if winter never came and seasons<br />
	was no reason to change<br />

	<h3>Mardukson - Vision</h3>
	&nbsp;

	<p>once i heard a dream i was young and naive<br />
	a man named Martin had it and i believed<br />
	that all men were gonna be a brother to me<br />
	and together we were gonna live peaceful and free<br />
	a vision of the future it was looking good<br />
	the times were a-changing and it was all good<br />
	a vision of the future i heard in the roar<br />
	of the long haired hippie screaming war no more<br />
	the brave Black Panthers standing in their shades<br />
	on the steps of power with the shotgun raised<br />
	a vision of the future i saw in the name<br />
	of the man named Ali who used to be Clay<br />
	<br />
	once i read a dream and it touched my life<br />
	a man they called the Christ had it and it was like<br />
	a vision of the future i never could see<br />
	a dream of utopia that never could be<br />
	every day i live in this world of pain<br />
	i never get the answers to the questions i raise<br />
	like why do a man have to kill to live<br />
	and why do so many people need a pill to feel<br />
	something else besides nothing but pain<br />
	why the world keeps turning and nothing ever change<br />
	i guess i&#39;ll let it be cause itz all in vain<br />
	seeking words of wisdom that don&#39;t mean a thing<br />
	(whispered words of wisdom let it be)<br />
	<br />
	visions of the past scroll through my mind<br />
	more and more as i leave it furthur behind<br />
	i think it was the best and the worst of times<br />
	all the good men flexed and the great men died<br />
	the hour of the woman was at 12 oclock<br />
	i can still see &#39;em with their faces locked<br />
	in anger cause they saw that it was all a crock<br />
	nothing but a ruse to keep them locked in the box<br />
	everywhere the sounds of breaking chains<br />
	all colors and kinds in the night air clang<br />
	white men dying for the Black men&#39;s pain<br />
	and a vision of the future that will never change<br />
	a knoll of the future i though had rang<br />
	when i first heard the Beatles and Mccartney sang<br />
	<br />
	(whispered words of wisdom let it be)<br />

	&nbsp;

	<p>I i walked a mile<br />
	in my baby&#39;s shoes<br />
	and i i learned what i<br />
	was pushing her to do<br />
	i i turned around<br />

	talk to her the way<br />
	<br />
	men who love their women do<br />
	because i love her yes i do<br />
	and i know my daddy&#39;s ways<br />

	<br />
	thatz why i walked a mile<br />
	in my lady&#39;s shoes<br />
	when i saw in her eyes<br />
	what she was gonna do<br />
	i i thought a while<br />
	about my hurtful ways<br />
	and i i changed my style<br />
	started doing things<br />
	<br />
	that men who love their women do<br />
	because i love her yes i do<br />
	and i saw my daddy&#39;s ways<br />
	make my mama run away<br />
	i want her to stay<br />
	forever and ever<br />
	[Rap]<br />
	when we go for a ride<br />
	open the door<br />
	help her inside talk to her more<br />
	treat her like a lady never curse<br />
	when we make love make her come first<br />
	never get loud when we&#39;re out on the town<br />
	let everybody know i&#39;m in love and proud<br />
	of my lady everyday<br />
	<br />
	cause i dont want her to go away<br />
